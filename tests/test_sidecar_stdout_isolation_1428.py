"""A sidecar's frame channel must not be shared with library logging (#1428).

Every sidecar speaks a length-prefixed binary protocol on stdout. It is not
the only thing writing there: the libraries it loads print freely to fd 1 —
wetextprocessing's FST logs, tqdm bars, native prints from torch and ONNX
runtime. Those bytes interleave with frames, the parent reads four bytes of
log text as a length prefix, and the generation dies with

    OSError: frame too large: 1044258881

(that number is ASCII text). The worse half is what it leaves behind: the
stream is now desynced, so every later request on the same sidecar reads
stale bytes and no retry can recover — which is why the reporter saw
alternating failures rather than a clean one.

Reported by @1335-Group against IndexTTS-2 with a tested fix. The defect is
not IndexTTS's: all nine sidecars wrote frames to `sys.stdout.buffer` and none
protected fd 1, so any of them breaks the moment a dependency prints.

These tests are the deterministic guard — a new sidecar copied from an old one
must not be able to reintroduce it.
