"""#1960 — a rejected source language must say WHICH code it rejected.

The report was "400 Bad Request: Invalid source language code" and nothing
else. That cannot be acted on or triaged: it does not say which of the ninety
or so codes was wrong, so neither the user nor a maintainer reading the
auto-filed issue can tell whether the picker offered something the backend
does not accept, or a stale preference from an older build is still being
sent. I could not determine the cause from the report — which is the point.

The value is a language code chosen from a menu, not private data, and the
neighbouring engine validator already echoes its input the same way.

The last test is the durable one: it reads the picker's own list and asserts
the backend accepts all of it, so a code added to the menu cannot silently
become a 400.
