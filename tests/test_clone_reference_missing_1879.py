"""#1879 — "clone without a reference clip" must not be reported in library terms.

mlx-audio raises a bare ValueError naming its own parameters:

    No conditionals available. Either provide audio_prompt/audio_prompt_sr for
    voice cloning, or ensure conds.safetensors is in the model directory.

The generate route passed that straight through as the 400 detail, so the user
was told to supply an argument they have no way to name and to check for a file
they have never heard of. What actually happened is simply "you asked to clone
without giving anything to clone from".

The route still passes through every ValueError it cannot classify — most are
VoiceStudio's own validation messages and are exactly what the user should
read, so the fix must not swallow them.
