"""Queue wait is not compute time (#1190/#1202).

Field reports: a 22-chunk batch dies around chunk 3 with "the job was too heavy
for the available compute", on hardware that renders chunk 1 and 2 fine. Three
defects in `run_on_gpu_pool_guarded` / `_ResilientGpuPool` compound into that:

1. The 300s clock started at SUBMIT. `loop.run_in_executor()` returns
   immediately, so `asyncio.wait_for` was timing the queue wait, not the work.
   A job queued behind a busy 1-worker pool burned its entire budget without
   executing one instruction and then blamed the hardware.
2. `reset()` used `cancel_futures=True`, so one request's timeout cancelled
   innocent QUEUED peers, which surfaced to their own callers as a bare
   CancelledError.
3. The timeout message promised "Capacity was restored automatically". It
   isn't: Python cannot kill the abandoned worker thread, which keeps running
   (and holding the device) until it finishes.

Plus the v0.3.22 length-scaled budget was wired into only two of the eleven
GPU dispatches, which is why 0.3.22 users still saw "exceeded 300s".

Every test below fails on the pre-fix code and passes after.
