"""#1826 — a degenerately short input must not surface as torch conv internals.

A one-or-two-character generation reaches a convolution whose kernel is wider
than the tensor it was given, and torch says so in its own terms:

    Calculated padded input size per channel: (1). Kernel size: (2). Kernel
    size can't be greater than actual input size

That arrived doubly wrapped in "Underlying error:" and told the user nothing
they could act on. The fix on their side is simply "type more than one
character", which the message never said.

It is also worth classifying because it is NOT transient: the engine will fail
the same way on every retry, and the generic wording invites exactly that.
