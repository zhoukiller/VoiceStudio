"""Locale key parity — all 21 i18n files stay in lockstep with en.json.

Replaces the manual locale sweeps: CLAUDE.md's Localization rule routes every
UI string through ``frontend/src/i18n/locales/*.json``, which only works if
every file parses, carries no keys en.json doesn't have, and preserves en's
``{{placeholder}}`` tokens. Real bug classes this pins down:

* a translation that drops ``{{message}}`` shows users a bare error with the
  detail silently lost (six ``gallery.*`` keys drifted this way in all 20
  translations before this test existed);
* a machine-translation pass that mangles the token itself renders it
  literally in the UI (vi.json shipped 31 strings saying ``_V_0__``, and
  ar.json once translated ``{{n}}`` into Arabic);
* a key added to en.json only falls back to English for every other language.

Missing keys degrade gracefully (i18next falls back to en), so full key parity
is enforced as a RATCHET: each locale's missing-key count may only go down.
When en.json gains keys, add them to all 21 locales in the same change — that
is exactly the house rule this test automates.
