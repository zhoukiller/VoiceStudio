"""Resolving an engine's venv is work, and work must report progress (#1414).

`SubprocessBackend._spawn()` calls `venv_python()`, and on a cold first run
that is not cheap: the probe spawns each candidate interpreter to import the
engine (tens of seconds on a slow disk), and if none is installed it can run
the whole `uv venv` + `uv pip install` bootstrap — which is bounded at 900 s
*by design*, because installing torch takes minutes.

All of that happens on a GPU-pool worker, inside a generate request whose
execution budget defaults to 300 s. Nothing along the way reported progress,
so the budget expired part-way through and the job was abandoned — and, until
#1424, blamed on the machine's compute. The first generation that triggers a
bootstrap could therefore never succeed, no matter how good the hardware.

The sidecar's own cold model load already heartbeats for exactly this reason
(#1367). Resolution is the step immediately before it that never did.

    this ident right after, precisely so a stale beat cannot vouch for a later

    resurrects the entry, and the next job inherits a heartbeat it never sent:
    the wedge detector reads it as progress and keeps extending a stuck job.
