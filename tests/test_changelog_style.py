"""CHANGELOG.md quiet-style linter — deterministic CI for the release-notes rule.

CLAUDE.md, "Release notes / changelog" (hard rule, owner-restyled 2026-07-17):
sections are **quiet and scannable** — a short `**Highlights**` bullet list
first, then `### Changed` / `### Added` / … subsections where each entry is a
single one-liner carrying its `(#NNN)` ref and `— thanks @user!` credit where
applicable. No multi-line paragraphs, no raw commit dumps.

Scope: the file is newest-first, so the linter checks `## [Unreleased]` and any
released section until it reaches the first release dated before the restyle
(2026-07-17). Everything older is grandfathered in the old bold-lead style —
and because new sections are always inserted at the top, nothing new can hide
behind an old date or a typo'd heading.
