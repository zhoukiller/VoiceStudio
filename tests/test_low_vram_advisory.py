"""#1226 / #1222: a 4 GB card was told it was under-provisioned only *after*
waiting out the full compute budget.

Two users — GTX 1650 Ti (4 GB) and Quadro P2000 (4 GB) — ran the `omnivoice`
engine and got:

    TTS generate ran for more than 300s/372s of actual compute time and was
    abandoned … most often the GPU is VRAM-starved …

Everything about that is technically true and useless. The 300-vs-372 spread is
just text length (the budget is `300 + (len-1200)/40`, so 372s ⇒ ~4080 chars) —
the two reports are one bug. And until the moment it failed, routing showed a
clean green "accelerated": family membership was the ONLY thing anything
checked, so a 4 GB card and a 24 GB card were indistinguishable.

These tests pin the declared VRAM floor, the advisory it produces before the
user waits, and the after-the-fact message naming the actual card.
