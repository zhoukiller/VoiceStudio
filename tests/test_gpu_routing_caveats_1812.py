"""#1812 — an accelerated GPU with a caveat must name the RIGHT remedy.

`_check_gpu_routing` and the setup wizard's preflight both treated "accelerated
but with a routing_reason" as one case and printed the driver/architecture
remedy: "may fail at kernel launch — update drivers / reinstall torch for this
GPU architecture." A perfectly healthy CUDA card that merely has less free VRAM
than the engine wants also carries a reason, so a low-VRAM caveat told the user
to reinstall torch. That sends someone to rebuild a working toolchain over what
is really "close some other models first".

The two are now split on KERNEL_RISK_MARKER, which is the only marker that
means the kernels themselves may not launch.
