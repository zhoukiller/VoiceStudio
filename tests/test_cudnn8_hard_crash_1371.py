"""#1371 — a missing cuDNN 8 must not kill the backend process.

CTranslate2 4.4.0 (the engine under WhisperX and faster-whisper) requires
cuDNN 8 while torch ships cuDNN 9. When the side-loaded cuDNN 8 is absent,
CTranslate2 does not raise — it prints ``Could not locate
cudnn_ops_infer64_8.dll`` and ``__fastfail``s, taking the whole backend down
with ``0xC0000409`` (exit code ``-1073740791``). There is no traceback to
classify and no exception to fall back from, so the shell restarts the backend
and the next transcribe kills it again.

The backend already *knew*: ``main.py`` probed for the libraries and threw the
answer away. These tests pin the fix — the answer is kept, and the two
CTranslate2 engines report themselves unavailable so ``_auto_detect`` routes to
pytorch-whisper (torch's own cuDNN 9 stack) instead of walking into the abort.

The conservative half matters as much as the strict half: a false positive here
costs a user WhisperX's forced alignment, and therefore lip-sync accuracy. So
the "not gated" cases below (no CUDA, ROCm, macOS) are not padding — a fix that
disqualified CTranslate2 on those hosts would be a worse regression than the
crash it set out to fix.
