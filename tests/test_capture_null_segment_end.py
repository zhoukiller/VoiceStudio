"""
A segment timing the engine could not determine arrives as ``end: None``, and
the REST `/transcribe` response builder used to raise on it.

`_sherpa_result()` (services/asr_backend.py) sets ``duration = None`` when it
cannot derive one from the sample rate, and `OpenAICompatASRBackend`
`_adapt_response()` emits ``end: None`` for every plain-text (`json`/`text`)
response from a server that rejects `verbose_json`. Both reach this endpoint —
sherpa is the first capture engine and the OpenAI-compatible backend is
selectable as the active one.

`round(s.get("end", 0), 2)` does not defend against that: ``.get`` returns the
stored ``None`` rather than the default, because the key is present. The route
answered 500 for a transcript that was otherwise fine, which is the server-side
half of #1904.
