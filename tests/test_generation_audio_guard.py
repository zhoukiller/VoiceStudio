"""Generation audio guards (#629).

A numerical glitch (seen on MPS) could leave NaN/inf in the rendered audio,
which writes an unreadable WAV that then fails decoding with an opaque
"ffmpeg returned error code: 183 / Invalid data" — surfaced to the user as a
misleading "ran out of memory". Two guards: sanitize non-finite samples before
any encode, and classify a decode/ffmpeg failure as unreadable-audio (not OOM).
