"""#1804: a GPU below the engine's VRAM floor was budgeted as fast hardware.

Third report of one shape. #1226 (GTX 1650 Ti), #1222 (Quadro P2000) and now
#1804 (GTX 1650) are all 4 GB cards running the `omnivoice` engine, which
declares `min_vram_gb = 6.0` precisely because "below this the driver pages to
system RAM and a render that should take seconds runs for minutes".

The reporter's own breadcrumbs show the budget, not the hardware, ending the
job::

    11:53:02 generate:start → 11:59:14 stream-retryable-abort  = 372 s
    12:00:15 generate:start → 12:05:16 stream-retryable-abort  = 301 s

which is `generate_timeout_s()` exactly: 300 + max(0, len - 1200) / 40.

Everything downstream of the routing verdict already acted on it — the caveat
(`resolve_routing`), the preflight toast, the timeout message naming the card
(`test_low_vram_advisory.py`). The budget alone did not, so the slowest
supported configuration got **half** the 600 s a plain CPU host gets. These
tests pin the corrected floor, and the boundaries it must not cross.
