"""#874: a model download that fails because the CONFIGURED Hugging Face
mirror (HF_ENDPOINT, Settings → Models → Hugging Face mirror) is unreachable
must surface an actionable error that (1) names the mirror, (2) says it may be
down, (3) points at the setting AND says downloads pick up a mirror change
immediately (the download paths resolve the endpoint per call — the old hint
falsely claimed a restart was always required, dead-ending first-run users
whose only recovery path is switch-and-retry inside the wizard), and
(4) suggests the official endpoint when the model isn't cached — instead of
leaking the raw transformers message ("We couldn't connect to
'https://hf-mirror.com' …") as a bare 500 detail.

Fail-before/pass-after: before the fix `classify()` had no mirror class and
`build_failure()` / `append_hf_mirror_hint()` attached no hint to these
reasons. Also covers the #886 family: when the incomplete-cache auto-repair
fails, the surfaced message now names WHY (so a mirror outage / offline mode /
full disk stop reading identically).
