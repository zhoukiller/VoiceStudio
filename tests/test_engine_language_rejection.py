"""#1257: `400 Bad Request: Invalid language code. Supported languages: ar
(Arabic), da (Danish), de (German), …`

The reporter was on mlx-audio and got a bare recitation of 23 language codes.
Nothing in it says which engine is refusing, that OmniVoice offers 646
languages because a *different* engine supports them, or that switching engines
is the fix. Three generate attempts in their action log, all identical.

The cause is stated outright in `MLXAudioBackend.supported_languages`:

    # Per-model; Kokoro supports 8, Qwen3 ~4, Kugel 24. Return "multi"
    # so the language picker doesn't gate by engine — each engine
    # silently ignores languages it doesn't know.

The last clause is not true. The engine's library raises, so the picker offers
languages the active engine will reject, and the rejection arrives with no
context. Enumerating every model's real language list would be a brittle map
that goes stale on each engine update; naming the engine and the way out is
both accurate and durable.
