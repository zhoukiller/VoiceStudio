"""`docs/STRUCTURE.md` carries counts of the trees it describes.

Counts rot silently: the doc shipped "79 modules of business logic" when
`backend/services/` held 78, and nothing failed. A number in a doc that no
test reads is a number that is wrong the week after it is written, so the
counts are pinned here rather than trusted to review attention.

Per CLAUDE.md's token-economy rule, mechanical claims like this belong in a
deterministic test, not in agent or reviewer effort. When you add a router or
a service, update the doc — this test tells you which line.
