"""#1866 — an unavailable engine must say what KIND of problem it has.

Model Catalogue rendered "Engine unavailable. Check installation and
configuration." plus "Last error: A previous engine check failed." for engines
the user had simply never installed. Neither names a missing package, a missing
step, or a next action, and the second reads like a crash or a poisoned cache
rather than "you have not installed this yet".

The probe's own sentence still cannot cross the boundary — it carries exception
text, local paths and sometimes credentials. What changed is that the private
diagnostic is now CLASSIFIED into a VoiceStudio-owned category, the same shape
`_public_routing_reason` already uses for routing.
