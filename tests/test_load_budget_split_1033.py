"""Model LOAD time must not eat the GENERATE timeout budget (#1033/#1037 class).

Field evidence (#1014, measured on a Tesla T4): a fresh install's first
TTS request spent its entire OMNIVOICE_GENERATE_TIMEOUT_S window (300s)
downloading the multi-GB checkpoint — 0% GPU utilization throughout — and
died with the "too heavy for the available compute" 503. Two user reports
(#1033, #1037) match the signature. The generate guard was wrapping the
adapter's lazy `_ensure_loaded()` (weight download included) together with
the actual synthesis.

The fix gives loading its own, larger budget (OMNIVOICE_MODEL_LOAD_TIMEOUT,
default 1200s) via the new `TTSBackend.ensure_ready()` hook, dispatched
BEFORE the generate clock starts, in both /generate's adapter path and
/v1/audio/speech. These tests drive the class with a fake backend whose
"load" is slower than a tiny generate budget but inside the load budget —
fail-before (GpuJobTimeoutError from the generate guard), pass-after.

Engine-stub pattern from tests/test_agentic_provider_contract.py.

    Watermarking is disabled for the duration. It runs INSIDE the generate
    budget, and its first call in a process loads the AudioSeal model — which
    on a cold run takes longer than the 0.2s budget this test deliberately
    sets, so the request 503'd on the watermark rather than on anything to do
    with the load/generate split. That made the file pass in a full session
    (AudioSeal already warm from an earlier test) and fail when run alone,
    which is the wrong way round for a regression test: the isolated run is
    the honest one. The budget asymmetry is what is under test; the watermark
