"""Clearing the Tauri tab must not destroy the backend's stderr.

`/system/logs/tauri/clear` iterated every candidate in `_tauri_log_candidates()`
and truncated each one — including `backend_err.log`, the spawned backend's
stderr. Three things make that a data-loss bug rather than a tidy-up:

- The tab that owns the button does not show it. On desktop the Frontend/Tauri
  panel goes through the Rust `read_log_tail` command, whose `tauri_log_path()`
  resolves `tauri.log` and nothing else, so the user truncates a file they were
  never shown.
- `src-tauri/src/backend.rs::open_err_log_for_run()` opens it **append-only**
  so "a respawn must not destroy the previous run's evidence" (#1510) and
  rotates it to `.1` rather than truncating. It manages its own size; clearing
  it from here only undoes that.
- A native death — a Windows access violation (`0xC0000005`), a SIGSEGV — writes
  nothing to the Python log by construction, so this file is the only record
  that it happened. #1777 and #1782 are both threads where the maintainer had
  to ask a reporter for this file by hand.

Clear is therefore narrowed to the shell's own log. The READ path is unchanged,
and the last test pins that: `_tauri_log_candidates()` still lists all four
files in the same order on all three platforms, because the refactor that split
the list is where a silent regression would hide.
