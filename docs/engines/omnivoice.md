# VoiceStudio — OmniVoice Engine (default)

OmniVoice (k2-fsa/OmniVoice) is VoiceStudio's default TTS engine — the one a
fresh install uses without any configuration. It does zero-shot voice cloning
across 600+ languages and outputs 24 kHz mono audio. Voice cloning, dubbing,
and dictation all run on it out of the box.

## When to pick it

- You want cloning plus the broadest language coverage (see
  [languages.md](../languages.md)).
- You have a GPU (CUDA, AMD ROCm on Linux, or Apple Silicon MPS) with
  ~6 GB VRAM or more.
- You just installed VoiceStudio — it's already selected.

For low-VRAM or CPU-only machines, the
[OmniVoice GGUF](omnivoice-gguf.md) variant runs the same model through a
quantized native binary with a much smaller memory footprint.

## Requirements

- Runs on CUDA, AMD ROCm (Linux), MPS (Apple Silicon), or CPU — auto-detected.
- Recommended VRAM floor: **6 GB** on a dedicated GPU. This is the only
  engine with a measured floor: on 4 GB cards (GTX 1650 Ti, Quadro P2000 —
  issues [#1226](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/1226) /
  [#1222](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/1222)) the driver
  pages to system RAM and a render that should take seconds runs for minutes
  until the compute budget kills it. The UI warns before you wait; nothing
  hard-blocks, since short inputs can still fit. A CUDA or ROCm card below the
  floor is also budgeted as the CPU-class hardware it performs like — the longer
  `OMNIVOICE_CPU_GENERATE_TIMEOUT_S` (600 s), not the accelerated 300 s
  ([#1804](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/1804)). Apple Silicon
  is excluded: unified memory has no dedicated pool to compare against.
- No extra install — the model ships with the app and downloads its weights
  on first use (see [downloading-models.md](../downloading-models.md)).

## Selecting the engine

OmniVoice is the default, so normally there is nothing to do. If you switched
away and want it back:

- **Model Catalogue**, or
- set `OMNIVOICE_TTS_BACKEND=omnivoice`.

The env var overrides the persisted UI choice.

## Behaviour notes

- Weights load lazily on first use and are shared with the rest of the app
  (dubbing, dictation) — the model is never double-loaded.
- On CUDA and ROCm the model runs fp16 with `torch.compile`; PyTorch exposes
  ROCm/HIP devices through its `cuda` API, while VoiceStudio's engine matrix
  reports the hardware as ROCm. A speech recognizer is co-loaded for the
  cloning path.
- Output is 24 kHz mono; the shared mastering chain (highpass + compressor)
  is tuned for this rate and applied automatically.
- Cloning takes a short reference clip (`ref_audio`); 3–10 seconds is the
  sweet spot. A transcript of the clip improves conditioning — if the profile
  has none, VoiceStudio transcribes the clip automatically on first use and
  saves the result to the profile. A clip with a supplied transcript is limited
  to 20 seconds so the two stay aligned; trim both to the same passage. Without
  a transcript, VoiceStudio can search up to 75 seconds in five contiguous,
  bounded transcription passes and selects the passage with detected speech.
  Longer clips must be trimmed first. If no spoken words are detected, trim to
  a clear 3–10 second passage or provide its matching transcript.
- Encoded voice references persist on disk (`prompt_cache/` in the app data
  dir), so the first generation with a known voice after a restart skips the
  re-encode and any transcription pass. Set `OMNIVOICE_PROMPT_DISK_CACHE=0`
  to keep the cache in memory only.
- Style attributes (`instruct`) and a reference clip can be **combined**:
  when they agree, the instruct stabilizes cloning for the attributes it
  names (upstream documents dialect cloning as the canonical case — dialect
  reference + matching dialect instruct). When they conflict, the reference
  audio wins.
- Inline pronunciation control: Chinese via pinyin with tone numbers
  (`打ZHE2出售`), English via bracketed CMU phonemes (`[B EY1 S]`). Non-verbal
  tags like `[laughter]` are covered in
  [expressive-speech.md](../expressive-speech.md).
- Voice design works from attributes (gender, age, pitch, whisper, English
  accents, Chinese dialects) via the Design tab — no reference audio needed.
- Optional FlashInfer acceleration on CUDA: set `OMNIVOICE_FLASHINFER=1`
  (or `=graph` for CUDA-graph capture, best for one render at a time) after
  installing the `flashinfer-python` package — see
  [performance.md](../performance.md). Off by default; if the package is
  missing or a kernel fails, the app logs why and continues on the standard
  path.

## Known limits

- Voice design understands only the fixed attribute vocabulary — free-form
  design *prose* is mapped onto those attributes, and wording outside them
  is ignored. Design is trained on English and Chinese and can be unstable
  in low-resource languages; for description-driven design in other cases
  try [VoxCPM2](voxcpm2.md).
- Below the 6 GB VRAM floor on a CUDA or ROCm card, expect very slow renders;
  they get the longer CPU compute-time budget rather than the accelerated one,
  but can still time out. Prefer [OmniVoice GGUF](omnivoice-gguf.md) or a CPU
  engine such as [PocketTTS](pockettts.md).

## Troubleshooting

- "Too heavy for the available compute" on a small GPU: see the VRAM floor
  above — switch to OmniVoice GGUF or close other GPU apps.
- First generation is slow: the first call downloads multi-GB weights. To
  keep the first render quick, install the model ahead of time from
  **Model Catalogue (TTS tab → the engine's Weights)** — a long first generate is almost always the
  download, not a hang.
- General install issues: [install/troubleshooting.md](../install/troubleshooting.md).

A timed-out subprocess is killed and given a bounded wait to exit before the
request returns, so retrying cannot reuse its closing process. Timeout cleanup
remains tied to the original child and cannot kill a replacement sidecar.
If that wait cannot confirm exit, VoiceStudio retains the process for cleanup
and blocks another attempt until it can be reaped, rather than starting a second
engine alongside it. A later retry or shutdown retries the bounded cleanup.
