# VoiceStudio — Faster-Whisper Engine

Faster-Whisper runs Whisper on CTranslate2 — the same transcription core
WhisperX uses, **without** the wav2vec2 forced-alignment pass. It's the safe
cross-platform fallback when whisperx isn't installed, and the capture/dictation
fallback on non-Apple machines.

## Selecting it

- **Model Catalogue**, ASR tab → **Use** on the Faster-Whisper row, or
- pin it with `OMNIVOICE_ASR_BACKEND=faster-whisper`.

Auto-detect only picks it when [whisperx](whisperx.md) is unavailable.

## Best at

- **Subtitles, dictation buffers, and batch transcription** where Whisper's
  native word timing (±100–300 ms) is good enough.
- For dubbing lip-sync, prefer [whisperx](whisperx.md) (or
  [mlx-whisper](mlx-whisper.md) on Apple Silicon) — their forced alignment is
  an order of magnitude tighter on word boundaries.

## Platform support

- **CUDA** — float16, with automatic degradation (below).
- **CPU** — int8 on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Apple Silicon GPU / ROCm** — not supported: CTranslate2 has no Metal or
  HIP build, so those hosts run on CPU
  ([#1529](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/1529)); auto-detect
  routes them to mlx-whisper / pytorch-whisper instead.

## Model selection

`ASR_MODEL_FASTER` — default `Systran/faster-whisper-large-v3`. Accepts the
size aliases (`tiny` … `large-v3`, `distil-large-v3`) or any CTranslate2
Whisper repo on HF. Weights download on first load — see
[downloading-models](../downloading-models.md).

Segments are cleaned up by faster-whisper's built-in Silero VAD before
transcription.

## Degradation chains

- GPUs without efficient fp16 (older Maxwell/Pascal, GTX 16xx, or a
  CTranslate2/cuDNN mismatch) fail at model construction with a compute-type
  error; the engine walks float16 → int8_float16 → int8 instead of failing
  every chunk ([#551](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/551)).
- A CUDA out-of-memory falls back to CPU (slower, same model and accuracy) —
  flushing the resident TTS model frees VRAM for GPU-speed ASR
  ([#255](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/255)).

## Quirks

- **cuDNN 8 required on CUDA** — a missing cuDNN 8 would fast-fail the whole
  process, so the engine checks up front and reports itself unavailable
  instead ([#1371](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/1371)).
  pytorch-whisper covers that case on torch's bundled cuDNN 9.
- On some hardened Linux kernels the CTranslate2 native library is rejected
  with "cannot enable executable stack" (an OSError, not an ImportError) —
  reported as unavailable rather than crashing engine selection
  ([#692](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/692)).
- CTranslate2's GPU teardown can rarely segfault the process at unload. If
  you hit that, switch to the crash-isolated variant —
  [faster-whisper-isolated](faster-whisper-isolated.md)
  ([#730](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/730)).
- Transcribes are time-bounded: `OMNIVOICE_TRANSCRIBE_CHUNK_TIMEOUT_S`
  (default 120 s per dub chunk) and `OMNIVOICE_ASR_TRANSCRIBE_TIMEOUT_S`
  (default 300 s whole-file).

Speed comparisons across engines live in [performance](../performance.md).
