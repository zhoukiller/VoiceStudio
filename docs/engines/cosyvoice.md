# VoiceStudio: CosyVoice Engine

CosyVoice is an optional multilingual TTS backend for zero-shot voice cloning
and instructed speech. A one-click install runs it in its own
environment and process; an existing source installation keeps
running in-process.

## Downloaded weights and an available engine are different states

The Model Catalogue tracks model weights separately from engine runtime
availability. A downloaded
`FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512` cache means the model files reached the
machine. It does not prove that the VoiceStudio backend can import and run
CosyVoice.

The current readiness check requires the same Python interpreter that runs the
VoiceStudio backend to import:

```python
from cosyvoice.cli.cosyvoice import AutoModel
```

It then loads the directory named by `OMNIVOICE_COSYVOICE_MODEL`, or defaults
to `pretrained_models/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B`. That path must resolve to the usable
model directory, not only the parent Hugging Face cache directory.

## One-click install

Click **Install** in **Model Catalogue → Engines → CosyVoice**. VoiceStudio
gives CosyVoice its own folder under the data directory and its own Python
3.10 environment, and runs it there in a separate process. The install:

- clones a reviewed CosyVoice commit and the Matcha-TTS code it depends on;
- downloads the CosyVoice 3 weights (about 5.4 GB).

It differs from upstream's own setup:

- **PyTorch 2.7.0.** The CUDA 12.8 build on an NVIDIA GPU, the CPU build on
  other Windows and Linux machines, the regular build on Apple Silicon.
  Upstream's 2.3.1 exists only for CUDA 12.1 and cannot run on RTX 50-series
  GPUs.
- **Leaner dependencies.** No TensorRT, DeepSpeed or GPU onnxruntime, and no
  third-party package index. Upstream uses them for extra speed on Linux;
  synthesis works without them. Nothing needs a compiler, and SoX is not
  needed.
- **Patched dependencies.** Where upstream pins a release with a published
  security advisory (diffusers, hydra-core, lightning, modelscope, onnx,
  protobuf, transformers), the install uses the fixed release. That set was
  installed on Windows and passes the install's import check.
- **No text normaliser.** Upstream's (wetext) downloads its data from
  ModelScope on every model load, and ModelScope rate-limits those
  downloads, so a normaliser could half-download and fail silently. The
  one-click install leaves it out, and CosyVoice reads text as written:
  spell out numbers, dates and symbols where the pronunciation matters.
- **Only the weights CosyVoice 3 loads.** Not the RL and TensorRT variants
  that share its repository.

Nothing it installs touches VoiceStudio itself or any other engine, and
**Uninstall** in the same row removes only that folder. An existing source
installation keeps working as it is. The button is not offered on Intel
Macs, where PyTorch 2.7.0 has no build.

CosyVoice 3 has no built-in voices. With no reference clip, it speaks in the
voice of upstream's own sample prompt.

## Source builds and existing installations

The upstream CosyVoice project recommends its own Python 3.10 Conda environment
and SoX. The one-click install above gives CosyVoice that separate
environment. Installing upstream dependency pins into VoiceStudio's
shared backend environment can also conflict with other engines.

Existing source installations remain usable when the VoiceStudio backend's
interpreter can already import `cosyvoice.cli.cosyvoice.AutoModel`. Keep a
working installation in place. Before starting VoiceStudio, set
`OMNIVOICE_COSYVOICE_MODEL` to its usable model directory through the source
checkout's environment or project `.env` file.

For upstream setup details, read the
[official CosyVoice installation guide](https://github.com/QwenAudio/CosyVoice#install).
Those steps create a standalone CosyVoice environment. They do not turn the
current packaged VoiceStudio app into a CosyVoice installer.

## Diagnose an unavailable engine

Include these facts in a support question or bug report:

1. The exact VoiceStudio version.
2. The full reason under **Model Catalogue > Engines > CosyVoice** after
   selecting **Re-check**.
3. The CosyVoice lines from **Settings > Logs > Backend** immediately after
   that check.
4. On Windows, the output of `where.exe sox` in PowerShell.

These facts distinguish a downloaded-model state from a missing Python runtime,
missing SoX executable, or incorrect model directory. Do not delete a model
cache or reinstall dependencies until the log identifies which state failed.

The public report that exposed the misleading installed state is
