# VoiceStudio — VoxCPM2 Engine

VoxCPM2 (OpenBMB) is the studio-quality option: native 48 kHz output,
zero-shot voice cloning, and — uniquely among VoiceStudio's engines —
**voice design**: creating a synthetic voice from a text description
("young female, warm tone, British accent") with no reference audio at all.

## When to pick it

- You want voice design without a reference clip.
- You want the highest output sample rate (48 kHz vs OmniVoice's 24 kHz).
- Your language is among its 30 supported languages: Arabic, Burmese,
  Chinese, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew,
  Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Lao, Malay,
  Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish,
  Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese.

## Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.10, PyTorch ≥ 2.5.
- CUDA ≥ 12 recommended for full speed; MPS (Apple Silicon) and CPU also
  work.

## Setup

Install the package into VoiceStudio's Python environment:

```bash
pip install "voxcpm>=2.0.3"
```

That is a version **floor**, not a pin — an older install still works, but
the engine logs an upgrade hint at load time. Then select the engine via
**Model Catalogue** or `OMNIVOICE_TTS_BACKEND=voxcpm2`.

## Model selection

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OMNIVOICE_VOXCPM_MODEL` | `openbmb/VoxCPM2` | HuggingFace checkpoint to load |

The first use downloads a multi-GB checkpoint from HuggingFace. A download
interrupted near the end used to abort the load outright
([#1224](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/1224)); the load is
now retried once with a fresh client. See
[downloading-models.md](../downloading-models.md).

## Behaviour notes

- **Voice design:** provide a description and no reference audio.
- **Cloning:** the reference clip is prepared before use (edge-silence trim
  and length cap) so dead air in a raw clip doesn't condition the output; on
  any prep problem the raw clip is used as-is.
- **Style instructions** are passed as an inline prefix to the text.
- VoxCPM2 emits mastered, studio-grade audio, so VoiceStudio **skips its
  shared mastering chain** (which is tuned for 24 kHz engines) — only benign
  loudness normalization applies.
- A trailing-silence guard trims long near-silent tails from generations,
  keeping a short natural tail.

## Known limits

- Slower than the lightweight CPU engines — see
  [benchmarks.md](../benchmarks.md) and [performance.md](../performance.md).
- Language coverage is 30 languages; for anything else use the default
  [OmniVoice](omnivoice.md) engine ([languages.md](../languages.md)).

## One-click install

Click **Install** in **Model Catalogue → VoxCPM2**. VoiceStudio
puts VoxCPM2 in its own Python environment under its data directory and runs
it there, in a separate process. It installs the CUDA build of PyTorch on an
NVIDIA GPU, the CPU build on other Windows and Linux machines, and the
regular build on Apple Silicon.

Nothing it installs touches VoiceStudio itself or any other engine, and
**Uninstall** in the same row removes only that folder. An existing
`pip install voxcpm` setup keeps working as it is. The button is not offered
on Intel Macs, where no PyTorch build it needs exists. The model weights
download on first use.

## Troubleshooting

- Engine shows unavailable: the `voxcpm` package isn't installed — run the
  `pip install` above and restart VoiceStudio.
- Repeated first-download failures: check connectivity/HF access, then see
  [install/troubleshooting.md](../install/troubleshooting.md).
