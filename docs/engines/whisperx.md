# VoiceStudio — WhisperX Engine

WhisperX is the default ASR engine on CUDA and plain-CPU hosts: faster-whisper
(CTranslate2) transcription plus a **wav2vec2 forced-alignment** pass that
snaps word boundaries to ±10–30 ms (Whisper's own timestamps are ±100–300 ms).
That word timing is what dubbing lip-sync depends on, which is why auto-detect
prefers it wherever CTranslate2 can use the GPU.

## Selecting it

- **Model Catalogue**, ASR tab → **Use** on the WhisperX row, or
- pin it with `OMNIVOICE_ASR_BACKEND=whisperx` (the env var always wins over
  the Settings pick; with neither set, auto-detect chooses per-hardware).

## Best at

- **Dubbing** — the forced alignment is the accuracy tier lip-sync needs.
- **Batch transcription** with word-level subtitles.
- Multi-speaker work: it pairs with pyannote speaker diarization — see
  [diarization](../features/diarization.md).

## Platform support

| Host | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| NVIDIA CUDA | GPU, float16 (degrades automatically, see below) |
| CPU (any OS) | int8 — works, but slow for large-v3 |
| Apple Silicon | CPU only — CTranslate2 has no Metal build, so auto-detect prefers [mlx-whisper](mlx-whisper.md) there ([#1127](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/1127)) |
| AMD ROCm | CPU only — CTranslate2 has no HIP build, so auto-detect prefers [pytorch-whisper](pytorch-whisper.md) there ([#1529](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/1529)) |

## Model selection

- `ASR_MODEL_WHISPERX` — default `large-v3`. Accepts the usual size aliases
  (`tiny` … `large-v3`, `distil-large-v3`) or a full HF repo id. Weights
  download on first load — see [downloading-models](../downloading-models.md).
- `OMNIVOICE_ALIGN_DEVICE` — force the wav2vec2 aligner's device. Aligners
  exist for ~20 major languages; other languages keep Whisper's native word
  timestamps instead of failing.

## VRAM preflight and degradation

Loading fp16 large-v3 onto a nearly-full 8 GB card dies as a *native* CUDA
abort — no Python exception, the whole backend goes down
([#723](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/723)). So before every
load the engine checks free VRAM against per-compute-type budgets
(float16 5.0 GB, int8_float16 3.5 GB, int8 3.0 GB, scaled down for smaller
models) and degrades the compute type — or falls to CPU int8 — instead of
starting a load that would kill the process. Disable with
`OMNIVOICE_ASR_VRAM_PREFLIGHT=0`.

Two more fallback chains run at load time:

- GPUs without efficient fp16 (older Maxwell/Pascal, GTX 16xx) raise a
  compute-type error — the engine retries int8_float16, then int8
  ([#551](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/551)).
- A genuine CUDA OOM retries on CPU int8, so dubbing still completes
  (slower, same model and accuracy).

## Quirks

- **cuDNN 8 required on CUDA.** CTranslate2 links cuDNN 8; if it's missing the
  process fast-fails with no traceback, so the engine is reported unavailable
  up front and selection falls through to pytorch-whisper, which uses torch's
  own cuDNN 9 ([#1371](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/1371)).
- On some hardened Linux kernels CTranslate2's native library is rejected with
  "cannot enable executable stack" — reported as unavailable, not a crash
  ([#692](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/692)).
- A partially-installed environment (interrupted sync, antivirus quarantine)
  can break WhisperX's deep import chain (whisperx → pyannote →
  lightning_fabric). The engine is then reported unavailable with a repair
  hint — reinstall, or `uv sync --reinstall` on a source checkout
  ([#1185](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/1185)).
- Audio is decoded through VoiceStudio's validated ffmpeg, not a bare `ffmpeg`
  PATH lookup ([#479](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/issues/479)).
- Transcribes are time-bounded: each dub chunk by
  `OMNIVOICE_TRANSCRIBE_CHUNK_TIMEOUT_S` (default 120 s), whole files by
  `OMNIVOICE_ASR_TRANSCRIBE_TIMEOUT_S` (default 300 s). Raise them for very
  long files on slow hardware.
