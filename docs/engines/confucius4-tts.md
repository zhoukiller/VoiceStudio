# Confucius4-TTS (opt-in engine)

> **Status: validated end-to-end (2026-07-02).** The integration (engine
> registration, dedicated-venv bootstrap, sidecar wire protocol, opt-in gating)
> is done, the sidecar's pure logic is unit-tested
> (`tests/test_confucius4_sidecar.py`), and a live synthesis run on Apple
> Silicon (CPU) produced audible cloned speech — confirming the model API and
> the true output sample rate of **22 050 Hz**. CUDA is the recommended
> hardware; CPU works but is slow (~17× realtime — roughly 100 s for 6 s of
> audio). MPS also runs but is *slower* than CPU (~64× realtime), so the
> sidecar deliberately never selects it. The engine is gated behind
> `OMNIVOICE_CONFUCIUS4_TTS_DIR`, so it's completely inert until you opt in —
> it can't affect the default install on any platform.

[Confucius4-TTS](https://github.com/netease-youdao/Confucius4-TTS) (netease-youdao)
is an LLM-based multilingual / cross-lingual zero-shot voice-cloning TTS.

- **14 languages**: Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Spanish,
  Indonesian, Italian, Thai, Portuguese, Russian, Malay, Vietnamese.
- **Unconstrained cloning** — no reference transcript required.
- **Cross-lingual voice transfer** — keep one voice across languages.
- **License:** Apache-2.0. **Hardware:** NVIDIA GPU (CUDA 12.6) recommended;
  CPU validated on Apple Silicon but ~17× realtime. Output: 22 050 Hz mono.

Like IndexTTS-2 / MOSS-TTS-v1.5 / dots.tts, it runs in its **own subprocess venv**
so its dependency stack never touches the default VoiceStudio interpreter.

## One-click install

**Model Catalogue → Confucius4-TTS → Install** does the steps below
for you, on Windows, Linux and macOS. It installs into its own folder under VoiceStudio's data directory, with its own Python environment. Nothing it installs touches VoiceStudio itself or any other engine, so you can switch to it and back without breaking what already worked. **Uninstall** in the same row removes only that folder. On an NVIDIA machine it installs
the CUDA build of PyTorch; elsewhere it installs the CPU build. The ~5 GB of
weights still download on first synthesis.

The first synthesis downloads the weights, which takes a while on a slow
connection. The generation stays alive while the download makes progress;
if a stalled download runs out of time, raise the compute-time budget in
**Settings → Performance & Device** and try again.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/netease-youdao/Confucius4-TTS.git
cd Confucius4-TTS
uv venv --python 3.10
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Upstream ships **no `pyproject.toml`/`setup.py`**, so there is nothing to
> `pip install -e` — don't try; it fails. The VoiceStudio sidecar puts the clone
> on `sys.path` itself (the same thing upstream's `example.py` does).

**Model weights — all fetched automatically from HuggingFace on first
synthesis (~5 GB total, cached in `$HF_HUB_CACHE`):**

- `netease-youdao/Confucius4-TTS` — `t2s_model.safetensors` + `s2a_model.pt`
  (the tokenizer + `wav2vec2bert_stats.pt` already ship in the clone's
  `checkpoints/`).
- `facebook/w2v-bert-2.0` — semantic feature extractor (~2.3 GB).
- `funasr/campplus` — speaker-style encoder (small).
- `nvidia/bigvgan_v2_22khz_80band_256x` — vocoder (BigVGAN and CAMPPlus
  *code* is vendored in the clone's `external/`; no Amphion install needed).

Set your `HF_TOKEN` (Settings → Credentials) if you hit rate limits.

Then point VoiceStudio at the clone and restart:

- **macOS/Linux:** `export OMNIVOICE_CONFUCIUS4_TTS_DIR=/path/to/Confucius4-TTS`
- **Windows (PowerShell):** `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("OMNIVOICE_CONFUCIUS4_TTS_DIR","C:\path\to\Confucius4-TTS","User")`

Select **Confucius4-TTS** in Model Catalogue (TTS tab → **Use**). The first synthesis triggers
the weight downloads above, then generates.

### Optional overrides

- `OMNIVOICE_CONFUCIUS4_CONFIG` — path to `inference_config.yaml` if it isn't at
  `<clone>/config/inference_config.yaml`.

## Validation record (2026-07-02, Apple Silicon M-series, CPU)

The sidecar (`backend/engines/confucius4/main.py`) uses:

```python
from confuciustts.cli.inference import ConfuciusTTS
model = ConfuciusTTS(config_path=..., device="cuda")  # or "cpu"
audio = model.generate(text=..., lang="en", prompt_wav="ref.wav")  # → tensor
sr = model.sample_rate  # 22050
```

- ✅ **Live end-to-end run**: English zero-shot clone from a 9.5 s reference —
  6.06 s of audible speech (peak 0.85) in 102 s on CPU. `model.sample_rate`
  returned **22 050**, matching `target_sample_rate` in
  `config/inference_config.yaml`; `CONFUCIUS_SAMPLE_RATE` /
  `_DEFAULT_SAMPLE_RATE` are pinned to it (regression-tested).
- ✅ **Not pip-installable upstream** — discovered live; the bootstrap now skips
  the editable install unless upstream ships packaging, and both the import
  probe and the sidecar resolve `confuciustts` via the clone on `sys.path`.
- ✅ **MPS probed and rejected**: runs, but ~4× slower than CPU (Metal op
  fallbacks) — the sidecar selects CUDA when available, else CPU, never MPS.
- ✅ **Sidecar logic unit-tested** (`tests/test_confucius4_sidecar.py`):
  language normalization, tensor→PCM (mono/stereo/clip), config-path
  resolution, clone sys.path injection, wire framing, synthesize dispatch.

## Accelerator routing

The sidecar passes a runtime-available CUDA/ROCm, XPU, or registered NPU
through upstream's device-aware model loading. The engine venv needs a matching
PyTorch/vendor runtime, also noted in the catalogue install hint. XPU/NPU selection is covered by mocked loader and routing
tests; this change does not certify synthesis on physical XPU/NPU hardware.
MPS keeps the existing CPU fallback described in the validation record above.
If modern accelerator detection or the legacy CUDA probe raises, loading falls
back to CPU instead of aborting before model construction.
