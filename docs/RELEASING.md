# Releasing — self-updating builds for mac / linux / windows

This doc covers the release workflow after the auto-updater wiring landed. Read top-to-bottom the first time. After that, cutting a release is the three commands in §5.

## 1. One-time repo setup

The signing key was generated locally at `~/.tauri/omnivoice-updater.key` (private) and `~/.tauri/omnivoice-updater.key.pub` (public). The public key is already embedded in `frontend/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` — that's what shipping clients use to verify updates.

The private key needs to live in **GitHub Actions Secrets** so CI can sign each release:

1. Read the private key contents:
   ```
   cat ~/.tauri/omnivoice-updater.key
   ```
2. GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → **New repository secret** (on `debpalash/VoiceStudio`, which is where the updater endpoint points):
   - Name: `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - Value: paste the full contents (including the `untrusted comment:` header line)
3. Add a second secret:
   - Name: `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`
   - Value: leave blank (the key was generated without a password)

**Back the key up.** Copy `~/.tauri/omnivoice-updater.key` to a password manager or encrypted vault. If you lose it, you can never ship an update for any client that has the current public key — they'll be stranded and need a manual reinstall.

## 2. One-time account setup (you)

**Rotate the leaked GH token** (the `ghp_...` in `origin` remote). See the session transcript — already flagged. Do this before anything else.

No Apple Developer / Windows signing certs needed for v1. Apps ship unsigned; first-launch shows "unverified developer" warnings that users bypass with right-click → Open (mac) or "Run anyway" (Windows SmartScreen). Self-update still works — Tauri's updater verifies via its own signing key, independent of OS code signing.

## 3. What the updater does

On every app launch, the webview:
1. Fetches `https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/releases/latest/download/latest.json`
2. Compares the version in `latest.json` to the running app's version (from `tauri.conf.json`)
3. If newer, shows a native dialog: *"A new version (x.y.z) is available. Download and install now?"*
4. If user accepts, downloads the signed update bundle, verifies the minisign signature against the embedded pubkey, replaces the app in place, relaunches.

Failures (no network, 404, signature mismatch) are silent — the app continues to launch normally. Check the frontend devtools console for `Updater check failed` messages if you're debugging.

## 4. Version bumps

`frontend/package.json` is the **single source of truth** for the app version
(hard rule, owner-set 2026-06-16 — full rationale in CLAUDE.md → Conventions →
Versioning). Vite injects `__APP_VERSION__` from it, and
`frontend/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` derives its bundle version from it
(`"version": "../package.json"` — never hand-edit a literal back in). Three
toolchain-required mirrors are bumped in lockstep:

- `frontend/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `backend/core/version.py` (`_FALLBACK_VERSION`)

Lockstep is guarded by `tests/test_app_version.py`. With `AUTO_VERSION_BUMP`
off (the current owner setting), `main` holds at the released version between
releases; the post-release bump to `X.Y.(Z+1)` happens only when the owner
asks. Keep bumps monotonic — the updater uses semver comparison, so `v0.2.0`
does not update clients already on `v0.2.1`.

## 5. Cutting a release

1. **CHANGELOG first (hard rule):** make sure `CHANGELOG.md` has a complete,
   user-facing `## [X.Y.Z] — DATE` section (rename `## [Unreleased]`).
   `release.yml` extracts that section verbatim as the GitHub Release body —
   a missing section ships a bare release.
2. Verify the version files match the tag you're about to cut:
   `uv run pytest tests/test_app_version.py -q`.
3. Tag and push:

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The `Desktop Release` workflow fires on tag push. It builds four targets in parallel on GitHub Actions runners:

| Target | Runner | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| macOS Apple Silicon | macos-14 | `.dmg` + updater `.app.tar.gz` |
| macOS Intel | macos-13 | `.dmg` + updater `.app.tar.gz` |
| Windows x64 | windows-2022 | `.msi`, machine-wide and per-user, each with its updater `.sig` |
| Linux x64 | ubuntu-22.04 | `.AppImage` + updater `.AppImage.sig` |

Each runner signs the updater payload with the stored `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, merges into a single `latest.json`, and attaches everything to the draft release.

Workflow runtime: **~20-40 minutes** (PyInstaller + four platform builds). Follow progress at:
`https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/actions`

The release stays a draft while the platforms build. Once every platform, the
updater-manifest repair and the uninstall scripts are done, the
`release-notes-checksums` job writes all four platforms' checksums into the
notes and publishes it, with no manual step. A failed platform leaves the
release a draft, so nothing half-built goes public. Existing clients detect
the update on their next launch.

## 5b. Deployment channels — all must ship (hard rule, owner-set 2026-07-16)

A version bump is not "released" until **every** channel below carries it.
Verify each one after the workflows finish — a missing channel is a release
bug to fix immediately, not backlog.

| Channel | Source | Produced by | How to verify |
|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub Release: installers + signed `latest.json` (**Stable** updater channel) | the `vX.Y.Z` tag | `release.yml` on tag push | Release page has dmg (arm+intel), msi (machine-wide and per-user), AppImage, `latest.json` and `latest-user.json`; body = the CHANGELOG section (not the auto-generated fallback), followed by per-platform checksums and a **Contributors** avatar strip (owner + every PR author for the tag — the `contributors-strip` job) |
| **Preview** updater channel (rolling `preview` prerelease) | **`main` only** | `release.yml` nightly cron / manual dispatch | preview `latest.json` uses main's version when it is ahead; otherwise it advances the stable patch, then appends `-N` so it semver-sorts above stable |
| GHCR CUDA image: `:X.Y.Z`, `:X.Y`, `:stable` | the tag | `docker.yml` on tag push | `docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/debpalash/omnivoice-studio:X.Y.Z` |
| GHCR ROCm image: `:X.Y.Z-rocm`, `:X.Y-rocm`, `:stable-rocm` | the tag | `docker.yml` on tag push | same, with `-rocm` suffix |
| Docker Hub mirror of **all** the above tags | the tag | `docker.yml` (gated on `DOCKERHUB_*` secrets) | tag list at hub.docker.com/r/palashdeb/omnivoice-studio/tags |
| Docker Hub **overview page** | `deploy/dockerhub-overview.md` @ main | `docker.yml` on main pushes | **read the step log, not the job status** — the step is `continue-on-error` and 403s silently when `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` lacks description-edit scope |
| Rolling Docker previews: `:latest`, `:main`, `:rocm` | **`main` only** | `docker.yml` on every main push | tag timestamps move with main |

**Preview/RC policy:** there are no RC tags (beta cadence — see CLAUDE.md).
The preview channel *is* the release candidate, and it **always builds from
`main`** — the preview-gate in `release.yml` refuses `publish_preview` from
any other branch, and the rolling Docker tags track `main` by construction.
To get users testing a fix: merge to `main`, then cut a preview. Never a
side-branch build.

## 6. Expect-to-fail-first-time on Windows and Linux

mac-ARM is tested locally. The other three platforms will likely hit PyInstaller issues on their first CI run because neither dependency set nor platform quirks have been exercised. Common failures to expect:

- **Windows**: `mlx_whisper` is mac-only — need to conditional-guard the import in `backend.spec`. `demucs`'s CUDA autodetect may pull wheels we don't want. Long-path limits during the PyInstaller bundle.
- **Linux**: `libasound` / `libwebkit2gtk` dev headers vs runtime confusion. AppImage FUSE assumptions on the runner.
- **mac-Intel**: should work, but torch wheels for x86_64 differ — watch for `nvidia-*` wheels sneaking in via the default torch.

When a target fails, either fix the root cause in the spec / workflow, or comment that matrix row out temporarily and keep the working targets shipping. The `fail-fast: false` setting means one failure doesn't kill the others.

## 7. Testing the updater locally (before shipping a tag)

Two options:

**Option A — dry run the manifest:**
After a release is published, hit the updater URL manually:
```
curl -L https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/releases/latest/download/latest.json | jq
```
You should see platform-keyed download URLs + minisign signatures. If that JSON looks right, clients will pick it up.

**Option B — full end-to-end:**
1. Install v0.1.0 on a fresh machine (or clean-installed Applications).
2. Cut v0.2.0 (bump, tag, push, wait for CI; the workflow publishes the release).
3. Launch the installed v0.1.0. Within seconds, the dialog should appear.
4. Accept → app downloads, verifies, replaces, relaunches as v0.2.0.

If step 3 silently does nothing, DevTools console in the app webview has the `Updater check failed:` log.

## 8. Rolling back

There's no "revert update" flow for clients — they'll only see a *newer* version. To roll back:
1. Delete the broken release from GitHub Releases (or mark it as pre-release).
2. Re-tag the previous good commit with a higher version (e.g., if you shipped bad `v0.2.0`, tag `v0.2.1` on the old `v0.1.0` commit).
3. Clients auto-update to the "new" v0.2.1 which is actually the old code.

Ugly but it works. Better plan: test with Option B above before publishing the draft.

## Retrying a partially published build

Use GitHub Actions **Re-run failed jobs** for the same release run. On retries,
the workflow removes only the current version's installers for that job's target
before Tauri uploads them again. A macOS retry also replaces that architecture's
versionless updater archive. Other versions, sibling platforms, and updater
manifests remain intact. Inventory or deletion permission/network failures stop
the job instead of hiding an upload collision.
