# Project Structure

Every folder has a single job. Every file at the root earns its place.

## Rules of the root

1. **Nothing at the root is a runtime artifact.** Outputs, temp files, local DBs, crash logs — all go to `~/Library/Application Support/OmniVoice/` (or the OS equivalent), *never* into the repo. The one exception is `omnivoice_data/`, which exists as a bind-mount anchor for Docker.

2. **No ad-hoc scripts at the root.** One-off debug scripts live in `scripts/`. Tests live in one of the three homes below, never at the root.

3. **Each subdirectory owns one concern.** If you can't describe what goes in a directory in one sentence, it's wrong.

4. **Every package has a manifest.** `backend/`, `frontend/`, `omnivoice/` each have their own deps declared via `pyproject.toml` / `package.json` — they are independently testable. The JS lockfile is the **repo-root** `bun.lock` (Bun workspace), and `deploy/Dockerfile` installs from it with `--frozen-lockfile`.

## Where tests live

Three homes, each with its own runner. CI runs all three inside the single `test` job in
`ci.yml`, as separate steps. The split is deliberate, not drift:

| Home | Runner | Why it's separate |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/` | `pytest tests/` — the `testpaths` default | The main suite. Its `conftest.py` points `OMNIVOICE_DATA_DIR` at a throwaway dir so a run can never touch the developer's real app state (#878). |
| `backend/tests/` | `pytest backend/tests/` — its own pytest session (the `Run pytest (backend/tests, isolated)` step) | Runs as an isolated session against `backend/`'s bare imports. Its `conftest.py` sets the same hermetic data dir; **never** reintroduce module-level `sys.modules` stubs there — they leak process-wide at collection time and poison mixed runs. |
| `frontend/src/**/*.test.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` | `bun run test` (vitest, jsdom) | Co-located with the component under test. `frontend/e2e*/` hold the Playwright suites; `tests/frontend/` is the older `node:test` set. |

## What lives where

| Kind of thing | Goes in |
|---|---|
| User-facing product code | `backend/`, `frontend/` |
| The TTS model (independent of the studio) | `omnivoice/` |
| A new TTS/ASR engine adapter | `backend/engines/<engine>/` |
| Everything executable but not user-facing | `scripts/` |
| Prebuilt platform sidecars | `bin/` |
| Python tests | `tests/` (or `backend/tests/` when the isolated session is required) |
| Frontend unit tests | next to the component, as `*.test.jsx` |
| Developer + user docs (Markdown) | `docs/` |
| Architecture decision records (ADRs) | `docs/adr/` |
| Agent-facing docs | `docs/agents/` |
| Runnable demos and sample data | `examples/` |
| Runtime data (never committed) | `~/Library/Application Support/OmniVoice/` on Mac |

## What *doesn't* live at the root anymore

Removed in the cleanup pass:

| File | Why it was there | Where it went |
|---|---|---|
| `test_crash.py`, `test_server.py`, `test_whisper.py`, `test_mock.py`, `test_pyannote.py` | One-off debug scripts from an April 14 crash investigation. Imported symbols that no longer exist after the router refactor. | Deleted (already gitignored, referenced dead code). |
| `benchmark.py` | Another stale debug script; imported `backend.main._get_db` which no longer exists. | Deleted. |
| `output.wav`, `test.wav` | Runtime artifacts. | Deleted / moved out. |
| `crash_log.txt` | Runtime log. Now written to `$DATA_DIR/crash_log.txt`. | Deleted. |
| `omnivoice.zip` (148 MB) | Offline reference archive of the project itself. | Moved out of the repo to `../omnivoice.zip.bak`. |
| `data/` | Only contained `.DS_Store`. | Deleted. |
| `legacy_gradio/` | The pre-React Gradio UI. Kept for historical reference. | Archived to `research/legacy_gradio/`, then removed in the 2026-07-12 cleanup (git history). |
| Scattered `.DS_Store` files | macOS Finder droppings. | Deleted from every non-ignored directory. |

Removed in the 2026-07-12 cleanup pass (all preserved in git history):

| Dir | Why it was there | Where it went |
|---|---|---|
| `.planning/` (74 files) | GSD-era planning archive: phases, quick plans, issue clusters. The GSD workflow was retired 2026-07-08. | Deleted; the four load-bearing decision docs moved to `docs/adr/`. |
| `specs/` | spec-kit specs for features 001–007 — all shipped. | Deleted; `docs/specs/` is the current home. |
| `design/` | ASCII mockups of the pre-React target UX, superseded by the shipped app. | Deleted. |
| `research/` | Archived legacy Gradio UI + April-2026 competitor notes. | Deleted. |
| `.agents/` | Rules for a third-party agent tool no longer in use. | Deleted — then reintroduced with a different job: `.agents/skills/` now holds the canonical skill copies pinned by `skills-lock.json`. |

## Scaling path (proposed, not yet executed)

The current flat layout works fine for the current size. If the project grows to include additional apps (a mobile companion, a plugin SDK, multiple backends), migrate to a Turborepo-style monorepo:

```
VoiceStudio/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/                 ← was backend/
│   ├── web/                 ← was frontend/
│   └── desktop/             ← could extract src-tauri/ here later
├── packages/
│   ├── omnivoice-model/     ← was omnivoice/
│   └── tts-adapters/        ← new; the pluggable TTS interface from ROADMAP phase 3
├── config/
│   ├── docker/
│   └── pyinstaller/
├── tests/
└── docs/
```

**Do not execute this migration without a dedicated PR.** It breaks:
- `pyproject.toml` `[tool.hatch.build.targets.{sdist,wheel}]` paths
- `package.json` workspaces and scripts
- `turbo.json`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` paths
- `backend.spec` (`['backend/main.py']`, `pathex=['.']`)
- `frontend/src-tauri/tauri.*.conf.json` sidecar paths
- every import that reads `from backend.main import …` (tests, scripts)
- `frontend/package.json` as the version source of truth, and the mirrors that track it

Migrate when adding the second `apps/*` or the second `packages/*`. Not before.

## Conventions

- **Filenames:** snake_case for Python, kebab-case or PascalCase for JS/TS components, lowercase for Markdown.
- **Tests mirror source paths** where a mirror exists: `tests/backend/` mirrors `api/ core/ engines/ services/`, so `backend/services/ffmpeg_utils.py` → `tests/backend/services/test_ffmpeg_utils.py`. Everything else stays flat — `tests/backend/test_*.py` for backend-wide cases, `tests/test_*.py` for cross-cutting ones. A React component's test sits next to the component.
- **One-off scripts** go into `scripts/` with a descriptive name, not `test_*.py` at the root.
- **New top-level directories** require a PR that updates *this file*.
