    // second one masquerade as "responded, but the field was absent", which
    // `code_fingerprint_is_current` treats as stale — silently killing a
    // perfectly healthy backend on a single flaky probe.
    //
    // The health probe (`/profiles`) and the identity probe (`/system/info`)
    // are still two separate requests — they hit different routes, so they
    // can't be folded into one fetch — which leaves a structurally similar
    // window open: two unsynchronized requests can never be atomic, so
    // EITHER ordering can pair the response of one process on the port with
    // a DIFFERENT process's response to the other probe if the port changes
    // hands between them. (This window predates #1770: the old code split
    // `running_backend_version` and `backend_deep_healthy` the same way, but
    // this PR makes the identity check load-bearing, so it's the right
    // place to reason about it explicitly rather than leave it implicit.)
    //
    // Reordering cannot remove that window — it only decides which side of
    // the pair can be stale, and the two failure modes are not equally bad:
    //   - identity-then-health (the naive order): a swap after the identity
    //     probe means we could attach on a STALE IDENTITY paired with a
    //     fresh health check — silently adopting code we never actually
    //     validated. That's exactly the #1770 bug, and nothing downstream
    //     ever re-checks identity on an attached backend, so it would be
    //     permanent for the life of the session.
    //   - health-then-identity (this order): a swap after the health probe
    //     means we could attach on a STALE HEALTH CHECK paired with a fresh
    //     identity — the code is correctly validated, only the "it was
    //     alive a moment ago" claim might be outdated. That failure is
    //     SELF-CORRECTING: an attached backend is polled continuously by
    //     `attached_backend_healthy()` in the supervisor loop (see its grace
    //     window — `attached_backend_health_grace_recovers_without_false_crash_or_port_failure`
    //     covers exactly this), so a backend that was actually unhealthy at
    //     attach time is caught and replaced within one poll interval.
    //     Identity has no equivalent recheck — that absence is the whole
    //     reason this PR exists — so its correctness must be established at
    //     attach time, as late as possible.
    //
    // Health is therefore probed FIRST and identity LAST, immediately
    // before the attach decision, deliberately choosing "stale health" over
    // "stale identity" as the side left exposed. A process swap that
    // happened before the identity probe is caught by that fresh read (the
    // version-mismatch and fingerprint-mismatch arms below fire exactly as
    // if the swap had always been there). The remaining exposure —
    // attaching to a backend whose health was confirmed a moment earlier
    // rather than at this exact instant — is irreducible without one atomic
    // endpoint returning identity + readiness together, and is accepted

// respawns it (bounded) so a crash self-heals.

// string* matches this build's. That's not the same as its *code* matching:
// per the Versioning convention, `main` holds ONE version string for an
// entire release cycle, so every commit merged during that cycle — including
// the one that fixed #1770 itself — reports the same `app_version`. A
// backend that answers with today's version string can still be running
// weeks-old code. The fingerprint below closes that gap: it's a content
// digest of the backend's actual `.py` sources, passed to a spawned child as
// `OMNIVOICE_BUILD_FINGERPRINT` and echoed back via `GET /system/info`
// (`code_fingerprint`), so the attach handshake can compare "the code this
// build ships" against "the code the already-running process loaded" instead
// of trusting a coarse version string alone.

/// Recursively collect every `.py` file under `dir`, as (label, path) pairs
/// where `label` is `"<root_label>/<path relative to dir>"` with `/`
/// separators (stable across platforms). Skips `__pycache__` and dotdirs

///     this failure is about — recommending "run this and retry" often
///     fixes nothing.
///   - greptile P1 (3rd instance): the previous fix told EVERY user to set
///     `env_dir` in `config.json` — but `setup::env_root` checks
///     `cfg.install_mode == "portable"` FIRST and returns
///     `portable_base().join("env")` without ever consulting `env_dir` (see
