"""Whole-file ASR transcribe must be wall-clock bounded (TamKieu / Vietnam report).

The chunked dub pipeline already bounds each chunk, but the whole-file paths
(dub QC re-transcribe, dictation, OpenAI-compat) ran unbounded — a slow/stuck
transcribe (e.g. large-v3 on a VRAM-starved GPU) hung the request *and* held a
GPU-pool worker, surfacing in the UI as the misleading "can't reach the local
backend". `run_transcribe_guarded` bounds them and raises `ASRTimeoutError` with
actionable guidance. These tests pin the timeout path, the pass-through path, and
that the error message tells the user what to do.
