"""core.run_sentinel — deployment-agnostic crash forensics (#1164).

Fail-before/pass-after: before the sentinel module existed, a backend process
death in a browser/dev/Docker deployment left NO backend-side evidence at all
(crash_log.txt is only written on *caught* route exceptions), so the next run
had nothing to report and "Can't reach the local VoiceStudio backend" arrived
with zero diagnostics. These tests pin the whole forensics contract: a
leftover sentinel with a dead pid becomes a crash record; a clean shutdown
never does; a live second instance is never misreported; the record store
mirrors the desktop shell's marker semantics (cap 3, ack watermark,
version gate, read-only reads).

    close. The desktop shell's quit path grants only a 2s grace before
    SIGKILL (``frontend/src-tauri/src/bootstrap.rs``

    mid-teardown.
