"""
ASR adapter interface — Phase 3.3 (ROADMAP.md).

One protocol, multiple engines. Today we ship:

    • FasterWhisperBackend — CTranslate2-based (the engine WhisperX uses).
                            Default on Linux, Windows, mac-Intel. Also fast
                            on mac-ARM so we use it as the cross-platform
                            baseline and only prefer MLX on mac-ARM when
                            explicitly installed.
    • MLXWhisperBackend   — mlx-whisper on Apple Silicon. Optional speedup,
                            only available when mlx wheels install (mac-ARM).
    • PyTorchWhisperBackend — last-resort fallback using the existing
                            `_asr_pipe` on the TTS model.

Both return the raw Whisper output dict so `services.segmentation.
segment_transcript(...)` can keep working unchanged — new backends normalise
their output to the `{"chunks": [{"text", "timestamp": (start, end)}]}`
shape the segmenter expects.

Selection via `OMNIVOICE_ASR_BACKEND` (default: auto-detect, prefers
faster-whisper because it's available on every platform we ship to).

    Stray introspection — PyTorch's op-registration machinery, pickling, a

    speechbrain guards against that by suppressing the import when the triggering
    frame is the stdlib ``inspect`` module — but the check is
    ``filename.endswith("/inspect.py")``, a hardcoded POSIX separator. On Windows
    the frame filename uses backslashes (``...\\Lib\\inspect.py``), so the guard

    The order used to be whisperx-first, unconditionally — and that quietly cost

    faster-whisper are CTranslate2, which has **no Metal backend**: on a Mac they
    transcribe on the *CPU*, no matter what GPU is sitting there. Measured on an
    M2, one 30 s dub chunk, whisper-large-v3: **90.4 s on WhisperX (CPU) vs 20.5 s
    on MLX (GPU)** — 3x slower than realtime, which is how a 16-minute video turned
    into a ~48-minute transcribe and looked like a hang.

    So the pick is device-aware:

      1. mlx-whisper    — **Apple Silicon only.** Runs the *same* whisper-large-v3
                          on the GPU, and we layer WhisperX's wav2vec2 forced

                          word timing — and therefore lip-sync — is unchanged.
                          Same model, same alignment, ~4x the speed.
      2. whisperx       — everywhere else: faster-whisper + wav2vec2 forced
                          alignment (±10-30 ms word timing). On CUDA it uses the
                          GPU, so it remains the right default there.
      3. faster-whisper — transcription only (no forced alignment); safe fallback
                          when whisperx isn't installed.
      4. pytorch-whisper — last resort; requires the TTS model to be loaded so it
                          can reuse `_asr_pipe`.

    Auto-detect only. An explicit ``OMNIVOICE_ASR_BACKEND`` or the ``asr_backend``

    ``purpose="dictation"`` mirrors the capture selection order (sherpa pref →
    parakeet-mlx → MLX turbo → faster-whisper → pytorch); anything else uses
    the offline dub/batch selection (:func:`active_backend_id`).
    ``sherpa_model_id`` lets the live-dictation WS pass its per-session
    ``?model=`` override. Installed state comes from the same HF-cache helpers
    the model store uses (see :func:`_repo_installed`), so the answer matches
    the Model Catalogue's install badges.
    ``skip_sherpa`` probes only the non-Sherpa capture fallback; silent-model
    recovery uses it before deciding whether persistent demotion is warranted.
    ``require_installed`` makes unknown/custom selections fail closed for that
    recovery path so it can never turn the normal fail-open policy into an
    implicit model download.

    FAIL-OPEN rule: a repo the model catalog doesn't know (a custom
    ``ASR_MODEL_*`` pin, pytorch-whisper's default repo, an unrecognized
    alias) returns None — the download CTA can only install catalog entries,
    so a payload here would trap the user in an un-installable CTA loop; the
    previous auto-download behaviour is the honest fallback. Never raises —
    a broken preflight must degrade to the old behaviour, not block ASR.
