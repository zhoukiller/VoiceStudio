    sites in generation.py's classic path — the streaming path the UI tries
    FIRST, plus /v1/audio/speech, batch, dub and archetype previews, all still
    used the flat 300s, which is why 0.3.22 users kept seeing "exceeded 300s"
    on long inputs. Lives here (not in a router) so every router shares it
    without importing generation.py.

    Policy: floor at the configured OMNIVOICE_GENERATE_TIMEOUT_S (accelerated
    hosts) or OMNIVOICE_CPU_GENERATE_TIMEOUT_S (CPU hosts — the latter wins
    for CPU whenever it is itself explicit, even if the former also is; see

    characters past a 1200-character free allowance — generous enough for
    CPU-class hardware, still bounded (a wedged job is caught in minutes, not
    hours).

    #1804: "accelerated" is not one performance class. A card with less VRAM
    than the engine declares it needs pages to system RAM over PCIe and renders
    SLOWER than the same machine's CPU would — yet, judged by device family
    alone, it was handed HALF the CPU budget. That inversion is what three 4 GB
    reporters hit (#1226 GTX 1650 Ti, #1222 Quadro P2000, #1804 GTX 1650), all
    on the engine that declares a 6 GB floor. Every layer already knew: routing
    raises a caveat, the preflight toast warns, and the timeout message names
    the card. Only the budget ignored it. So an under-provisioned accelerator
    now floors at the CPU budget — the class of hardware it actually performs
    like. ``min_vram_gb`` is the engine's declared floor; callers that pass
    ``engine`` get it read off the engine automatically. Native runtimes pass
    an explicit ``vram_gb=0`` when their dedicated-memory probe failed; that
    unknown capacity gets the same conservative CPU-class budget without
    claiming the card is under-provisioned in user-facing diagnostics.

    Two clocks (#1190/#1202):

    * ``queue_timeout`` (generous, ``GPU_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_S``) covers the time the
      job sits in the pool queue. Exceeding it raises :class:`GpuPoolBusyError`
      — the job is cancelled out of the queue before it ever runs, so no
      compute is wasted and the caller can retry verbatim.
    * ``timeout`` (``GPU_JOB_TIMEOUT_S`` by default) starts only when a worker
      actually picks the job up. Exceeding *that* is a genuinely wedged/too-slow
      job → :class:`GpuJobTimeoutError` + pool ``reset()``.

    Previously both were one clock started at submit: ``run_in_executor``
    returns immediately, so a job queued behind a busy 1-worker pool burned its
    entire budget waiting and then reported "too heavy for the available
    compute" without having executed one instruction.

    ``fn`` must be a zero-arg callable — wrap args with ``functools.partial``.
    Executors without ``reset`` (a plain ThreadPoolExecutor in tests) still get
    both bounds; only the reset step is skipped.

    ``min_vram_gb`` is the declared VRAM floor of the engine this job belongs
    to (``TTSBackend.min_vram_gb``); it only shapes the timeout MESSAGE. Left
    at 0 — the default, and correct for every non-TTS job on this pool
    (reference transcribe, watermarking, dub steps) — the under-provisioned-GPU
    wording is never used, because nothing measured says it applies (#1226).

    ``on_abandon`` is called once, after a job whose caller stopped waiting can
    no longer access its inputs. A queued job that is cancelled before it
    starts calls it immediately; a running thread calls it from ``_job``'s
    finalizer. Normal completion never calls it. This lets request-owned temp
    files outlive abandoned workers without delaying ordinary requests (#1668).
