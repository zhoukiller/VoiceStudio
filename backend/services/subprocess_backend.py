"""SubprocessBackend — long-lived sidecar-process TTS primitive (Phase 2.1).

The architectural keystone for engine isolation. Engines that need their
own Python venv (because their dependency pins conflict with VoiceStudio's
— IndexTTS demands `transformers<5`, VoiceStudio demands `transformers>=5.3`)
run inside a `subprocess.Popen` child interpreter. The parent backend
talks to them through length-prefixed JSON over the child's stdin/stdout.

Subclasses (e.g. ``IndexTTSSubprocessBackend`` in Plan 02-03, the future
Supertonic-3 backend in Phase 3) override exactly two class methods:

    @classmethod
    def venv_python(cls) -> Path: ...   # path to the engine's python
    @classmethod
    def sidecar_script(cls) -> Path: ...  # path to backend/engines/<id>/main.py

Everything else — spawn, ready-handshake, request/response, GPU-slot
accounting, atexit teardown, stderr drainage, process-group cleanup — is
owned by this base class.

NOT IMPLEMENTED with the multiprocessing module (Locked Decision D4 — no
process-cloning variants of any kind). The whole point of this primitive
is to run a *different* Python interpreter than the parent's;
multiprocessing can only clone the current interpreter, which defeats
the dependency-isolation goal. Anyone tempted to "simplify" this should
re-read 02-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 1.

Threat-model summary (see Plan 02-01 frontmatter):
    T-02-01 — DoS via length-prefix: hard cap 64 MB per frame in ``_recv``.
    T-02-02 — GPU slot leak on sidecar death: try/finally in ``generate``.
    T-02-03 — token bytes in stderr: drain via the same logging filter that
              AUTH-05 installed (``HFTokenRedactor``) on the root logger.
    T-02-04 — compromised sidecar emitting unexpected ops: parent allowlist
              ``PARENT_INBOUND_OPS`` rejects everything else.
    T-02-05 — nested containment: a retained POSIX supervisor process group or
              Windows Job owns each engine operation, while still permitting
              independent timeout teardown and cleanup on backend death.
