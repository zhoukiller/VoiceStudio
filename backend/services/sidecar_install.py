"""One-click sidecar-engine provisioner.

Some engines (IndexTTS 2.5, MOSS-v1.5, dots.tts, and Confucius4) have the
same shape and can't live in the app venv because they pin a ``transformers``
version that conflicts with the parent's ``>=5.3``. They run as sidecars:
a source checkout + a dedicated venv + (for IndexTTS-2) model weights in
``<checkout>/checkpoints/``. Until now provisioning that trio was four
manual terminal steps; this module turns it into a resumable background
job the Model Catalogue UI can start and poll.

Design notes (single source of truth for the choices):

* **Fetch: git primary, tarball fallback.** ``git clone --depth 1`` is the
  primary path (fast, matches the documented manual flow, and leaves a
  repo the user can update). When git is absent — common on Windows — we
  fall back to downloading the GitHub source tarball over HTTPS (httpx,
  honours proxy env vars) and extracting it with :mod:`tarfile`. A
  ``pip install git+https://…`` path was rejected because the engine
  *directory* must exist on disk anyway: the sidecar resolves its venv
  and model weights relative to it.
* **Managed install root:** ``DATA_DIR/engines/<engine_id>/`` — always
  user-writable (works in frozen/packaged builds where ``backend/`` is
  read-only), survives app updates, and never collides with a user's own
  clone. A user-managed install (env var already pointing at their clone)
  is left completely alone.
* **Weights ARE part of the install** for engines whose sidecar loads
  from ``<checkout>/<weights_subdir>/`` (IndexTTS 2.5's ``main.py`` reads
  ``$OMNIVOICE_INDEXTTS_DIR/checkpoints/config_v2_5.yaml`` — verified). The
  download goes through ``huggingface_hub.snapshot_download`` with the
  endpoint from :mod:`services.endpoint_race` (HF endpoint auto-select;
  **no hardcoded huggingface.co**) and the token from
  :mod:`services.token_resolver`.
* **Idempotent + resumable:** every step no-ops when its output is
  already healthy and repairs it when it is half-there (a checkout
  without ``pyproject.toml`` is re-fetched; a venv that can't import the
  probe module is re-installed; ``snapshot_download`` resumes weights).
* **Persistence:** on success the checkout path is written to
  ``os.environ[<env_var>]`` (the engine's bootstrap reads the env var, so
  it works immediately — no restart) and to ``prefs.json`` under
  ``env.<env_var>`` (restored into the environment at startup by
  ``main.py``), the same mechanism Settings' env panel uses.

Cross-platform: no symlinks, no shell strings (argv lists only), venv
layout resolved per-OS (``Scripts/python.exe`` vs ``bin/python``).
