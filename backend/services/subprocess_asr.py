"""Crash-isolated ASR backends (Wave 4.2 / Spec 7).

Native ASR engines (the whisper.cpp / CTranslate2 class) can segfault on GPU
teardown — a process-level crash that takes the whole backend down with it.
Running them in a child process turns that segfault into a *failed job*: the
sidecar dies, the parent surfaces a decorated error, and the next request
respawns a fresh sidecar.

This reuses ``SubprocessBackend``'s wire protocol + lifecycle (spawn, ready
handshake, length-prefixed JSON, GPU-slot acquire, and — critically —
respawn-on-dead-process: ``_spawn`` relaunches whenever the previous child
isn't alive). We add a ``transcribe`` op alongside the TTS ``synthesize`` op;
the TTS ``generate`` surface is stubbed since an ASR sidecar never synthesizes.

The base is engine-agnostic; concrete subclasses point ``sidecar_script()`` at
an engine runner. ``IsolatedFasterWhisperBackend`` wraps faster-whisper (the
CTranslate2 engine with the documented GPU-teardown crash) using the parent
venv — faster-whisper is already a dependency, so no separate venv is needed,
only process isolation.
