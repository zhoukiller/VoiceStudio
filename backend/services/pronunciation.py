"""Pronunciation lexicon — per-project word respelling (longform render, PR 8).

A pronunciation lexicon maps a word (or short phrase) to a respelling the TTS
engine pronounces correctly: ``{"OmniVoice": "Omni Voice", "Dr": "Doctor",
"GIF": "jiff"}``. The narration pipeline applies it to each span's text just
before chunking, so the engine never sees the hard-to-say original.

This module is the engine-agnostic, pure core:

  * ``apply_lexicon(text, lexicon)`` — whole-word, case-insensitive replacement
    of every key with its respelling. Word-boundary aware (``\\b``), so a key
    ``cat`` never touches ``category``; surrounding punctuation/whitespace is
    preserved (``"smith,"`` → ``"Smith,"``). Longest key first, so a key
    ``Dr. Smith`` wins over ``Dr`` on overlapping input.
  * ``normalize_lexicon(lexicon)`` — drop empty/whitespace keys, coerce values.
  * ``load_lexicon(path)`` / ``save_lexicon(path, lexicon)`` — JSON round-trip.

ReDoS safety: the matcher is a single anchored-alternation regex built from
``re.escape``'d keys joined by ``|`` and wrapped in word boundaries
(``\\b(?:k1|k2|…)\\b``). No nested/overlapping quantifiers, no user-controlled
quantifier — the keys are literals, so there is no catastrophic backtracking
(CodeQL py/polynomial-redos clean). Matching is done in one ``re.sub`` pass with
a callback, so a respelling that happens to contain another key is never
re-scanned (idempotent against its own output).
