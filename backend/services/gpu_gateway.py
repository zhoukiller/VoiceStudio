"""One door to a GPU — this machine's, or the one the user picked.

Every GPU call in this app used to be the same three lines inlined at ~30 call
sites: resolve a backend, ``run_on_gpu_pool_guarded`` it, translate the pool's
exceptions into an HTTP answer. That shape has exactly one destination baked
into it, so "run this on my 4090" could never be more than a badge. This module
is the seam that makes the destination a *parameter*:

    decision = gpu_gateway.decide("tts")          # local, or the chosen worker
    await gpu_gateway.prewarm("tts", backend=b, decision=decision)
    audio = await gpu_gateway.run("tts", local=..., remote=..., decision=decision)

Four calls, and each of them answers for both targets:

  * :func:`prewarm` — the model-load budget
  * :func:`run`     — the generate budget
  * :func:`status`  — supported / installed / downloaded / resident
  * :func:`download` — fetching weights

Design decisions that are load-bearing, and why they are not obvious:

**``prewarm`` and ``run`` are separate calls.** Collapsing them loses the
two-phase split documented at ``tts_backend.ensure_ready`` (#1033/#1037): a cold
adapter that loads lazily inside ``generate()`` spends the *generate* budget on
a multi-GB download and dies with "too heavy for the available compute". The
protocol mirrors the same split (``TaskModelLoading`` and
``Deadlines.model_load_seconds``), so keeping the two calls apart is what lets
one policy serve both targets.

**The local branch calls ``run_on_gpu_pool_guarded``; the remote branch does
not.** That function means "submit a zero-arg blocking callable to the local
thread pool". Its error taxonomy (``GpuPoolBusyError`` / ``GpuJobTimeoutError``,
plus a pool ``reset()``) describes local saturation, and its ``started.set()``
handshake is a second timeout regime that would race the attempt ``Deadlines``.
A remote job is bounded by the lease and the phase budgets instead.

**This is not a ``RemoteBackend(TTSBackend)``.** ``generate()`` is synchronous
and returns a tensor, so a remote implementation would block a pool thread on
an async round-trip *while holding a GPU-pool slot* — a hard deadlock at
``OMNIVOICE_GPU_WORKERS=1``, which is the default on the machines that most
want to offload. It would also cover none of the non-TTS GPU work.

**Admission control lives here.** ``check_gpu_admission`` reads *local* pool
stats; called unconditionally it would answer 429 "the local GPU pool is
saturated" while the remote 4090 sat idle. It runs on the local branch only.

**Fallback is three rules, not one** (see ``worker/routing.py``'s header):

  1. *Pre-dispatch* unavailability — the worker is offline, disabled, paused,
     the queue is full, or nothing ever accepted the task — runs locally,
     quietly, with the named reason. Nothing ran remotely, so nothing is lost.
  2. *Mid-job* failure on a single-shot interactive op raises
     :class:`RemoteJobFailed`. Silently redoing minutes of work on the slower
     machine, with no explanation, is not a kindness.
  3. *Multi-unit* jobs (audiobook chapters, batches) pass a :class:`JobRun`;
     after N consecutive remote failures the job latches local for the rest of
     its units and reports **one** aggregated notice, instead of 160 identical
     error rows because a 4090 went to sleep at chapter 40.
