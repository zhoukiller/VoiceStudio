"""Pure, host-aware routing resolver — maps an engine's declared ``gpu_compat``
against the cached host capabilities to "where will this engine *actually* run
on this machine, and is that a problem the user should hear about?"

No model load, no probe (the caller passes the cached ``HostCaps``), no I/O.
Deterministic and byte-identical for a given ``(gpu_compat, HostCaps)`` across
macOS/Windows/Linux — that cross-OS determinism is the whole point of the
no-silent-fallback contract.

Reason strings are author-controlled English (interpolating only family/device
names) but are **still** scrubbed by the caller (``core.scrub.scrub_text``)
before serialization, because an interpolated ``device_name`` or probe note can
carry a home path.
