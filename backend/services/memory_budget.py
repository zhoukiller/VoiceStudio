"""Free-memory probe + a non-blocking low-memory advisory.

The device-caps probe (core.device_caps) reports *total* memory, resolved once
per process. Load decisions need *free* memory at the moment of loading — and on
Apple Silicon the number that matters is free **system RAM**, because MPS uses
unified memory (there is no separate VRAM pool). This module fills that gap.

Deliberately advisory, never blocking: a hard "refuse to load" on an estimate
would brick legitimate loads on machines that would actually cope (the estimate
can't know a model's true resident size ahead of time, and the OS can reclaim
cache under pressure). Instead it surfaces a warning so the UI and logs can say
"you're low on memory" — and the single-active-engine eviction
(services.engine_memory) is what actually reclaims room before a load.

Stdlib + psutil (already a runtime dep). Never raises.
