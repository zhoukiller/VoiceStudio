"""Central scheduler.

Two structural decisions the council settled, both of which shape everything
else in this module:

**One central queue.** The original design gave every worker its own queue with
its own depth and maximum size. That produces head-of-line blocking — a task
committed to a busy worker waits while another sits idle — and then demands
work-stealing to undo. Here the queue is central and workers hold only in-flight
slots, so a task is bound to a worker at the last possible moment.

**Filter, then strategy, then tiebreak.** The original had seven user-selectable
strategies *and* a ten-factor ranked scheduler, with no rule for how they
compose — so "always use my primary" and "never use an unhealthy worker" could
each claim to be authoritative. The pipeline here is unambiguous:

    1. hard filter   — enabled, connected, consented, capable, has capacity,
                       breaker closed, not excluded, not draining.
                       A user strategy can NEVER override these.
    2. strategy      — priority-ordered or least-busy, over the survivors.
    3. tiebreak      — warm model first, then lower load, then higher priority.

Model residency is in the tiebreak rather than the strategy because it is a
latency term, not a preference: a warm model is seconds away and a cold one can
be minutes.
