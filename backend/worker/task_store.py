"""Durable task state for remote work.

The local ``core/job_store.py`` marks every in-flight job failed on startup,
because a local job died with the process that was running it. Remote tasks
invert that: the control plane is a desktop app the user quits at will, and the
GPU on the other machine keeps rendering regardless. So restart must *recover*
in-flight tasks, not bury them.

The one ordering rule that makes at-least-once delivery safe:

    persist the result, THEN send RESULT_ACK

If the acknowledgement goes first and the server dies before writing, the
worker has been told it may drop its copy — and a forty-minute dub is gone with
no error anywhere. ``commit_result`` writes inside the same transaction that
flips the task to completed, so the ack can only follow a durable fact.

# for a clone, a source video for a dub — lives in ``VOICES_DIR`` or a tempdir
# on the *control plane*, so sending its path is sending a string that names
# nothing on the far side. That is why remote cloning could not work: the
# assignment carried ``ref_audio=/Users/…/voices/x.wav`` and the worker either
# failed to open it or, worse, rendered with the default voice.
#
# Staging copies those files into the artifact directory the control plane
# already serves over ``DownloadArtifact``, which refuses anything outside it.
# The copy is named by the SHA-256 of its contents, so cloning the same voice
# a hundred times keeps exactly one copy on disk and lets the worker's own
# cache skip the transfer entirely on every clone after the first.
