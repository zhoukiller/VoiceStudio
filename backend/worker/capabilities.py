"""Capability discovery on a worker.

What the scheduler needs is not "which engines exist" but four separate facts
per model, because they have wildly different consequences:

  * **supported**  — this engine could run on this host at all
  * **installed**  — its sidecar venv is actually present
  * **downloaded** — its weights are on disk (otherwise the first task pays a
                     download, which can be twenty minutes)
  * **resident**   — it is loaded in VRAM right now, which is the difference
                     between eight seconds and several minutes

Collapsing those into one boolean is how a scheduler sends a task to a worker
that then spends a quarter of an hour fetching a model, blows its deadline, and
gets penalised for it.

Everything here is derived from what the app already knows —
``tts_backend.list_backends()`` and ``device_caps`` — rather than a second,
divergent notion of what a worker can do.
