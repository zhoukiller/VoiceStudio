"""Task and attempt lifecycle.

The original goal doc had a contradiction the council flagged as its single
worst correctness bug: ``§10`` reassigned a task the moment a worker
disconnected, while ``§21`` described the case where that same worker had
already finished the work and lost the connection before the acknowledgement.
Following both rules at once guarantees duplicate execution — two GPUs burning
on the same dub, two results racing to commit.

The fix is to stop treating a disconnect as a failure. A disconnect is an
**unknown outcome**. The distinction is carried structurally here:

  * ``TaskState``    — what the *task* is doing. One per task.
  * ``AttemptState`` — what one *try* is doing. Many per task.

A disconnected attempt does not fail; it stops renewing its lease. Only when
the lease expires (grace window) does it become ``ATTEMPT_LOST`` and free the
task to be retried. If the worker reconnects inside the window carrying a
finished result, that result commits and no second attempt was ever made.

Commit semantics: **at-least-once execution, exactly-once result commit**. The
first attempt to durably commit wins; any later duplicate is acknowledged and
discarded so the worker stops redelivering, and its losing sibling is
cancelled. This is why ``commit_result`` is idempotent on ``task_id`` rather
than on ``attempt_id``.
