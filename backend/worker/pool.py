"""Live worker state.

Everything here is in-memory and rebuilt from reconnection, by design: sessions,
capacity snapshots, latency, breaker state. A desktop control plane restarts
constantly, and none of this is worth persisting when the worker itself will
tell us the truth the moment it reconnects.

What the pool owns is the *current* picture — who is connected, on which epoch,
with what free capacity and which models warm. What it deliberately does not
own is anything durable (``registry``) or any scheduling policy
(``scheduler``).
