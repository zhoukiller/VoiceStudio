"""Deadline policy for remote tasks.

The original goal doc proposed 2s to accept, 30s to execute, 35s to deliver.
Every one of those numbers is wrong by one to two orders of magnitude for this
product: ``model_manager`` budgets 300s of *execution* scaled by input length,
allows a cold load up to 1800s beyond that, and takes 30s just to spawn an
engine sidecar. A dub runs for minutes; an audiobook for hours. Fixed
second-scale deadlines would mass-kill healthy work.

Two ideas replace them, and both already exist locally — this module only
carries them across the wire:

1. **Phases, not one clock.** Accepting is fast (seconds). Loading a cold model
   is slow (minutes) and gets its own bounded budget. Executing is scaled to
   the input. Delivering a result is a transfer, not compute.

2. **Progress leases, not wall clocks.** ``model_manager`` already treats a job
   as wedged only when it is *silent*, not when it is slow
   (``MODEL_LOAD_HEARTBEAT_GRACE_S``). The same rule governs remote attempts: a
   worker that keeps reporting progress keeps its lease.

All values are **relative durations computed by the server**. Worker wall
clocks are untrusted — they skew, and a laptop that slept has a clock that
jumped.
