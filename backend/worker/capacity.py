"""Worker capacity — derived, never declared.

The original goal doc let a user configure "Whisper: concurrency = 4, large TTS
model: concurrency = 1". This repo's own history says that is unsafe:

  * compiled inference is pinned to a single thread because torch.compile's
    cudagraph state is thread-local (#315) — a second concurrent job on a
    compiled model produces *silently corrupted audio*, with no exception to
    catch and nothing for a reliability score to detect;
  * two concurrent clone jobs on an 8 GB card produced a sticky CUDA
    illegal-memory-access that aborted the whole process (#567), which is why
    ``gpu_queue`` is a deliberately serial single lane;
  * Apple's unified memory means "GPU memory" is shared with everything else
    the user is running, so a number that was safe at configuration time is not
    safe at execution time.

So capacity is computed from what the machine has *right now*, clamped by
device family, and the worker's own accept/reject is authoritative — the
scheduler's view is only ever advisory.

One more rule the repo learned the hard way: a timed-out GPU job cannot be
killed. The thread keeps the device until it finishes on its own
(``_ResilientGpuPool.reset()`` reclaims nothing). So a timeout must NOT return
the slot; the slot stays occupied by a zombie until the worker confirms the
thread exited. Returning it early is how a worker gets overcommitted into an
OOM.

But a park with no way out is just as wrong as no park at all: a worker whose
only slot is parked never gets another assignment, so it never produces the
confirmation that would release it, and it heartbeats "idle, 1 free" forever
while the scheduler considers it full. Two bounded exits, neither of which
trusts the worker's own accounting (which counts asyncio tasks, not GPU
threads, and so reports a parked slot as free the moment the task object is
gone):

  * a **TTL** sized from the budget the stuck job was given — past that, its
    thread is either finished or wedged beyond anything we can wait out;
  * **reconciliation** against the worker's reported ceiling — if the worker
    is running as many tasks as it says it can hold, the park is protecting
    nothing, because the overcommit it exists to prevent has already happened.
