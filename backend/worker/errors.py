"""Worker-protocol error taxonomy.

Why this exists: ``§22`` of the original goal doc listed "retryable errors" and
"non-retryable errors" without saying who decides. Without a single classifier
every worker invents its own strings and the scheduler retries deterministic
failures around the whole fleet — the "poison task" scenario, where one bad
input quarantines every machine that touches it.

The rule the scheduler needs is not "did it fail" but "would trying somewhere
else help":

    TRANSIENT   → yes, retry elsewhere; the worker is charged for it
    CAPABILITY  → yes, retry elsewhere; the worker is NOT charged (it simply
                  cannot run this model — a 4 GB card refusing a 6 GB engine
                  is correct behaviour, not flakiness)
    CAPACITY    → yes, immediately; never charged (the worker is doing its job)
    TIMEOUT     → maybe, per attempt budget; charged only if the worker was
                  otherwise healthy
    TERMINAL    → no. Fail the task now.
    PROTOCOL    → no retry of the task; the *session* is what is broken.

This module maps the app's existing docs taxonomy (``core.failure.classify``)
onto those classes rather than inventing a second vocabulary, so a failure that
already has a user-facing hint keeps it when it crosses the wire.
