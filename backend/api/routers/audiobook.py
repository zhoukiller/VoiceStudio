"""Audiobook creator endpoints (parity Wave 5).

``POST /audiobook/plan`` — pure preview: parse a chapter-delimited script
(Markdown ``# H1`` chapters, inline ``[voice:NAME]`` / ``[pause …]``) into the
chapter/span plan, no synthesis.

``POST /audiobook`` — the synth job: render each chapter through the active TTS
backend (reusing ``services.audiobook.synthesize_chapter`` + ``chunked_tts``),
then mux the chapter WAVs into a chapterized **m4b** (FFMETADATA1 chapters via
``build_m4b_cmd``). Progress streams as Server-Sent Events, mirroring the dub
pipeline. ffmpeg-gated — without ffmpeg the job reports an error event and
stops (the m4b is the only output format).

``GET /audiobook/jobs`` + ``POST /audiobook/resume/{job_id}`` — durable
crash-resume: an interrupted render persists its plan + params to a
``resume.json`` manifest in the job work dir, so it can be resumed later (the
content-addressed chapter cache makes finished chapters instant) even without
the original script. The resume UI affordance remains a follow-up.

epub/pdf ingest, ACX mastering shipped; the resume UI surface remains a follow-up.

      engine + each voice's resolved signature (+ the lexicon, so a lexicon

      deliberately miss once and re-render marked; with watermarking off the
      derivation is unchanged and released-version caches keep hitting.
      ``seg_stats`` is ``None``.
    * Inner — on a chapter miss, each spoken span goes through the
      :class:`services.longform_render.SegmentCache` under
      ``cache_dir/segments``: cached segments load from disk, only the
      edited/missing ones synthesize, and each fresh segment persists the
      moment it renders (an interrupted chapter resumes from them).
      ``seg_stats`` is ``{"total": spoken_spans, "cached": reused}``.

    Span text is normalized (``services.text_normalization``) up front — BEFORE
    either cache key and BEFORE ``synthesize_chapter``'s lexicon pass, so the
    per-project dictionary operates on normalized text and toggling / changing
    normalization output naturally invalidates cached chapters and segments.
