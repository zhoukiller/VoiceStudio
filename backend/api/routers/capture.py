"""
Standalone transcription endpoint for the Capture / Dictation feature.

Unlike /dub/transcribe/{job_id}, this endpoint is job-free — callers POST
raw audio bytes and get back transcribed text immediately.  Used by:

    • The frontend "Capture" (global hotkey dictation) mode
    • The MCP server's future `transcribe_audio` tool
    • CLI consumers that just want speech-to-text

The ASR engine is whatever `load_active_asr_backend()` returns — WhisperX
by default, or MLX Whisper on Apple Silicon when configured. The *loader*,
not the bare selector: it also runs `ensure_loaded()` and falls through to
the next healthy engine when the selected one has a broken deep import chain
(#1185), which the shallow `is_available()` probe cannot see.
