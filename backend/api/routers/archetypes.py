"""Voice-gallery archetype API.

Serves the catalog of *designed* voice archetypes from ``core.archetypes`` and
renders previews / materializes them into voice profiles on demand.

Design notes
============
* All heavy imports (the TTS model, torch) are deferred into the render
  functions so this module imports cleanly in test/CI environments without
  model weights. The pure endpoints (categories / list / get) and the preview
  *cache-hit* path never touch the model.
* Rendering reuses generation.py's proven ``_run_inference`` / ``get_model`` /
  ``_safe_torchaudio_save`` rather than re-deriving the ``model.generate``
  signature — one inference code path, one place to keep correct.
* Previews are cached on disk keyed by a hash of (instruct, language), so two
  archetypes that resolve to the same voice share a cache file and the cold
  render only happens once per distinct voice.
* That same key names the pre-rendered clips in the opt-in voice gallery
  (``services.gallery``), which is consulted BEFORE the engine so a fresh
  install can hear voices before the 2.4 GB checkpoint finishes downloading.
  Gallery files win over a local render of the same key — but only for
  ``/preview``. ``/use`` always renders locally: the WAV it keeps in
  ``VOICES_DIR`` is the reference audio a cloned voice is built from, and a
  downloaded MP3 must never become that.
