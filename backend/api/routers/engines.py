"""
Engines router — Phase 3 wiring.

Exposes the three adapter registries (TTS, ASR, LLM) so the Settings UI can
render an engine picker + availability reasons.

    GET  /engines                       → { tts, asr, llm }
    GET  /engines/{family}              → list of backends
    POST /engines/select                → persist a backend choice in prefs.json
    GET  /engines/{engine_id}/health    → spawn-or-ping for SubprocessBackend
                                          subclasses; ``is_available()`` for
                                          in-process backends (Plan 02-04)

Environment variables (`OMNIVOICE_TTS_BACKEND`, `OMNIVOICE_ASR_BACKEND`,
`OMNIVOICE_LLM_BACKEND`) still win over the UI choice so power-users can pin
a backend without Settings silently undoing it.

# background job, GET polls its step-by-step status (the Model Catalogue
# Install button polls this), DELETE removes an app-managed install.
#
# Path namespace: /engines/sidecar/{engine_id}/… — NOT /engines/{engine_id}/…
# — because a dynamic segment there would shadow pre-existing literal routes
# (this router registers before sonitranslate's, so a dynamic
# POST /engines/{engine_id}/install would swallow
# POST /engines/sonitranslate/install). Mirrors the
# /engines/translation/{engine_id}/install namespace pattern.
#
# Desktop-only: installing spawns git/uv against mutable source and writes an
# editable environment. An API key does not make that supply-chain path safe to
# trigger remotely. The job runs fine in packaged builds: the venv lives under
# the user data dir, not inside the signed app bundle, and uv resolves via

# that users can verify a SubprocessBackend engine is alive without
# kicking off a full synthesize. For an in-process backend the check is a
# cheap ``is_available()`` round-trip; for a SubprocessBackend subclass
# the call spawns the sidecar (if not already up) and round-trips a ping
# frame. Result includes wall-clock latency so the UI can render
# "1234 ms — pong" inline next to the button.
#
# Admin-gated (T-02-13): only the local desktop frontend or an authenticated
# server-mode administrator may trigger a sidecar spawn through this endpoint.

# Engine instances cached for the lifetime of the FastAPI process so that
# repeated health checks don't spawn a new SubprocessBackend (each spawn
# allocates a sidecar venv probe + atexit hook). The cache is keyed by
# class to survive registry-sandbox tests that rebind ids transiently.
#
# It now lives in services.tts_backend — the worker executor needs the same
# warm instances and cannot import an API router without inverting the
# layering. This name is the SAME dict object, kept so the existing consumers
# (engine_memory eviction, model_lifecycle inventory/unload) go on working
# unchanged; rebinding it here would fork the cache in two.

# ── Real-synthesis self-test (in-process TTS engines) ──────────────────────
#
# ``/health`` above is a liveness/import probe — for an in-process backend it
# only calls ``is_available()`` and the UI labels the result "deps OK". This
# route goes one step further: for an AVAILABLE, IN-PROCESS TTS engine it runs
# a *tiny real synthesis* from a fixed short phrase and reports duration +
# sample-rate + sample count, proving the engine actually emits audio rather
# than merely importing. The Compat Matrix's "Self-test" button calls it.
#
# Guardrails (kept identical across macOS/Windows/Linux per the default-feature
# rule — the phrase, timeout and gating don't branch on OS):
#   * TTS family + available + in-process only. Subprocess engines keep their
#     spawn-and-ping ``health_check`` (a real synth there is a sidecar
#     cold-start — out of scope for a click-to-test affordance).
#   * Bounded wall-clock timeout (``OMNIVOICE_SELFTEST_TIMEOUT_S``, default 90s):
#     a runaway synth returns ``ok=False`` / ``timed_out=True`` instead of
#     hanging the Settings panel. The orphaned worker is best-effort daemon.
#   * A process-wide lock serialises self-tests so a click-storm can't stack
#     concurrent model loads.
#   * Only ever on user click (POST) — never on Settings load. Admin-gated.

# Deliberately short + ASCII so the synth stays CPU-cheap and the phrase never
# trips the no-hardcoded-CJK guard.
