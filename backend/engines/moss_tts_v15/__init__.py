"""MOSS-TTS-v1.5 sidecar package (issue #498).

MOSS-TTS-v1.5 is OpenMOSS's 8B flagship TTS — a Qwen3-8B language backbone
plus a 1.6B audio codec, 31 languages, zero-shot voice cloning, token-level
duration control and inline ``[pause Ns]`` markers. Apache-2.0.

It runs in its own subprocess **and its own venv**, isolated from the
OmniVoice parent process, for the *same* reason IndexTTS does: a hard
``transformers`` version conflict. MOSS-TTS-v1.5's ``torch-runtime`` extra
pins ``transformers==5.0.0`` (verified against the upstream
``pyproject.toml``), while OmniVoice pins ``transformers>=5.3.0``. The two
cannot share one interpreter — so MOSS lives behind ``SubprocessBackend``
with a dedicated venv, exactly like ``engines.indextts``.

Three public entry points live in this package:

  * ``MossTTSV15Backend`` (this module) — the SubprocessBackend subclass
    that ``services.tts_backend._LAZY_REGISTRY`` resolves on first access.
    Defined HERE (not in ``services.tts_backend``) to break the import
    cycle: ``services.subprocess_backend`` imports ``TTSBackend`` from
    ``services.tts_backend``, so the backend class must live downstream of
    that module finishing its import. Same indirection as IndexTTS /
    Supertonic-3.
  * ``main.py`` — the sidecar entrypoint (runs under MOSS's venv with
    ``transformers==5.0.0``; never imported by the parent).
  * ``bootstrap.py`` — the venv-probe + lazy-bootstrap helper.

Do NOT import ``main.py`` from the parent process — it runs under a
different venv (``transformers==5.0.0``) and importing it in-process would
re-introduce the exact conflict this isolation exists to avoid.

Hardware routing follows the sidecar's runtime-available PyTorch accelerator:
CUDA/ROCm, XPU, or a registered NPU. MPS remains excluded; CPU is the fallback.
XPU/NPU routing is covered with mocked device contracts, not physical-hardware
synthesis certification; users need a compatible torch/vendor runtime in the
isolated engine venv.

    """MOSS-TTS-v1.5 (OpenMOSS) — 8B, 31 langs, zero-shot clone, CUDA/CPU.

    Runs in a long-lived sidecar over length-prefixed JSON-over-stdio in a
    dedicated venv (``transformers==5.0.0``). The first synthesize cold-loads
    ~16 GB of bf16 weights (CUDA) / fp32 (CPU); subsequent calls reuse the
    process and the in-memory model.

    Installation (transparent to power users who already cloned MOSS-TTS —
    OmniVoice prefers their existing ``${DIR}/.venv``)::

        git clone https://github.com/OpenMOSS/MOSS-TTS.git
        cd MOSS-TTS
        # CUDA host:
        uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[torch-runtime]"
        # non-CUDA host (CPU): install plain torch/transformers instead of +cu128

    Set ``OMNIVOICE_MOSS_TTS_V15_DIR`` to the clone root. OmniVoice creates
    ``backend/engines/moss_tts_v15/.venv`` lazily on first launch if no venv
    exists yet (CUDA hosts only — the upstream ``torch-runtime`` extra is
    ``+cu128``); the user's existing ``${DIR}/.venv`` is preferred if
    present, so no re-install is needed.

    License: Apache-2.0 (code + weights) — no acceptance gate needed.
