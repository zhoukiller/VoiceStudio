"""OmniVoice GGUF backend — subprocess host for the `omnivoice-tts` C++ runtime.

Architecture (Phase 4 Plan 04-01):

    Parent (this class) ──spawn──► bin/omnivoice-tts-<platform>
                          ◄─wav─── soundfile.read(<out_path>)

The C++ binary is the isolation boundary; the per-engine venv that
``SubprocessBackend`` would normally create is unnecessary because
``omnivoice-tts`` has no Python deps of its own (it statically links
GGML/GGML-cpu and dlopens GGML-cuda / GGML-vulkan when present).

This module intentionally does NOT subclass :class:`SubprocessBackend`
because that primitive owns a long-lived sidecar with a JSON-over-stdin
protocol that ``omnivoice-tts`` does not speak. Instead, each
``generate()`` call ``subprocess.Popen``s the binary fresh, passes the
text on stdin per the README invocation pattern, and reads the output
WAV from a temp path. The classes share the same "isolation through OS
process" philosophy but the wire protocols are different — the
SubprocessBackend's length-prefixed JSON is a stronger contract than
the `omnivoice-tts` CLI offers.

Security (see plan front-matter threat model):
    T-04-01 — Tampering of bundled binary: SHA-256 manifest verified by
              :meth:`is_available` on every call. Sums live in
              ``bin/checksums.sha256``.
    T-04-02 — Subprocess arg injection: argv is composed from typed
              ``pathlib.Path`` objects rooted in ``$HF_HUB_CACHE`` or a
              ``tempfile.mkstemp()`` output path. ``shell=False`` always.
    T-04-03 — GGUF quant served from network: ``huggingface_hub`` enforces
              SHA verification at download time; revision is pinned to
              ``quant_map.json._meta.source_commit_sha``.
    T-04-04 — HF_TOKEN leak into stderr: subprocess stderr is decoded
              through ``services.tts_backend._mask_hf_tokens`` before
              landing in any logger record.
    T-04-05 — Quant override UI loads attacker path: validated by
              :func:`services.settings_store.set_quant_override` against
              the ``quant_map.json`` allow-list before reaching this
              module.
    T-04-06 — DoS via hung subprocess: every spawn enforces a hard
              timeout (5 s for ``probe_load``, 120 s for ``generate``).

Public surface:
    :class:`OmniVoiceGGUFBackend` — the registered TTSBackend class.
    :func:`select_default_engine` — module-level resolver used at app
        start to decide between ``"omnivoice-gguf"`` (when probe + load
        succeed) and ``"omnivoice"`` (the existing in-process fallback).
