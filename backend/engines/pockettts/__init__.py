"""pockettts: Kyutai PocketTTS as a crash-isolated, CPU-only TTS sidecar (#1306).

PocketTTS (kyutai-labs/pocket-tts, 100M params) is hired for the "fastest CPU
render / lowest latency" job, the row the engine-acceptance framework leaves
unheld: every CPU engine OmniVoice ships is either English-only or a quality
engine falling back to CPU. PocketTTS is the complementary opposite end of the
spectrum from the quality engines (omnivoice, IndexTTS, Supertonic-3): small,
fast, CPU-only, zero-shot cloning from a reference clip. Six languages
(en/fr/de/pt/it/es), one model per language, selected via the ``language``
kwarg. Measured ~8-9x real-time on an Apple M3 Pro (see
scripts/bench_engines_latency.py, PR #1322).

This engine runs PocketTTS in a child process via :class:`SubprocessBackend`,
mirroring engines/omnivoice_subprocess and engines/supertonic3. Crash isolation:
a wedged generate is hard-killed by the parent's watchdog, reclaiming the
child's memory, the thing an in-process engine structurally cannot do. CPU-only
by design (``gpu_compat = ("cpu",)``): Kyutai observes no GPU speedup for this
100M, batch-1 model.

Opt-in (Settings -> Engines, or ``OMNIVOICE_TTS_BACKEND=pockettts``); the
default ``omnivoice`` engine is unchanged, so existing users see no behaviour
change.

Licence: MIT (code) + CC-BY-4.0 (weights), both commercial-OK (cleared from
primary sources in #1306). The weights are gated on HuggingFace (an access
agreement plus an acceptable-use clause); the engine must surface that honestly
at first-run rather than failing inside a download (condition 6 of the #1306
acceptance). That preflight is built on top of this shape, not in it.

Streaming note: PocketTTS streams audio (``generate_audio_stream``), but this
batch sidecar returns one audio frame per synth, matching the SubprocessBackend
contract every other subprocess engine uses. A streaming-aware variant
(incremental audio frames) is a documented opportunity to recover PocketTTS's
~33 ms time-to-first-audio end-to-end; out of scope for this shape, raised on
the PR.
