"""voxcpm2-subprocess: VoxCPM2 from its own venv (one-click install).

VoxCPM2 used to run only in-process, which meant installing ``voxcpm``, and a
torch of its choosing, into VoiceStudio's own environment. The one-click
installer now gives it a venv under ``DATA_DIR/engines/voxcpm2/``, and this
class runs the model there in a sidecar, so nothing it installs can touch the
app or another engine.

The engine id stays ``voxcpm2``. ``tts_backend._effective_backend_class``
resolves to this class once that venv exists and to the in-process
``VoxCPM2Backend`` otherwise, so an install made with ``pip install voxcpm``
keeps working as it always has. What the app sees is the same: voice design,
48 kHz output, its own mastering, the same languages. The parent still
prepares the reference clip and trims the silent tail, as the in-process
engine does.
