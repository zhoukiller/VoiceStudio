"""cosyvoice-subprocess: CosyVoice 3 from its own venv (one-click install).

The in-process engine needs CosyVoice importable from VoiceStudio's own
interpreter, which upstream's setup (its own Python 3.10 environment, pins
that conflict with the app's) never provides. The one-click installer clones a
reviewed CosyVoice commit and the Matcha-TTS code it vendors as a submodule
into ``DATA_DIR/engines/cosyvoice/``, builds a Python 3.10 venv from a trimmed
requirements list (``requirements.txt`` beside this file), downloads the
CosyVoice 3 weights, and this class runs the model there in a sidecar.

The engine id stays ``cosyvoice``. ``tts_backend._effective_backend_class``
resolves to this class once that venv exists, and to the in-process
``CosyVoiceBackend`` otherwise, so an existing source installation keeps
working as it did.
