"""Shared pipeline-failure helper (plan-04 / #131).

Single source of truth for "what a failure looks like" so every emit site —
the TaskManager worker, the dub ingest pipeline, the dub/batch routers — produces
the same structured, **non-empty**, sanitized failure event instead of its own
ad-hoc ``str(e)`` (which is empty or cryptic for many exception types, and was
the root of the "extract: unknown error" reports in #122/#63).

Guarantees:
  - ``reason`` is ALWAYS non-empty (falls back to the exception class name).
  - ``detail`` / ``diagnostic`` are sanitized: HF tokens, ``*TOKEN*/*KEY*/*SECRET*``
    env values, and absolute home paths never leak (Constitution I).
  - the 5-class docs taxonomy is reused from ``core.error_docs_map`` (not
    duplicated) so the deeplink contract stays single-sourced.

    "WINDOWS_UNTRUSTED_MOUNT": "Windows refused to walk a folder on the way to this file because the path crosses a mount point it does not trust (WinError 448). That is a Windows rule about the VOLUME, not about VoiceStudio or the file itself — it turns up on Dev Drives, on mounted VHD/ReFS volumes, and on junctions pointing into another user profile, so retrying the same link cannot help. Point VoiceStudio at a folder on an ordinary local drive instead: Settings → Storage → data directory, or the download/output folder named in the message.

The download is written to a job folder under your VoiceStudio data directory (Settings → Storage shows the path): check that drive isn't full, that the folder exists and is writable, and that antivirus or a cloud-sync client (OneDrive, Dropbox) isn't locking it — add a VoiceStudio exclusion if you use one. If your data directory sits on a synced or network drive, move it to a local one.",
    "OS_INVALID_ARGUMENT": "The OS rejected a file operation (Errno 22 / invalid argument) — in the transcribe path this is the temporary WAV write before ASR. It's almost always the temp directory: missing, read-only, on a full or removed drive, or blocked by antivirus.

    "SSL_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE": "A corporate or antivirus proxy is intercepting HTTPS traffic and re-signing certificates with its own CA — your OS trusts that CA, but Python's bundled certifi CA list doesn't, so the TLS handshake fails even though the connection reached the server. Newer VoiceStudio builds trust the OS certificate store at startup (the truststore package), which should already fix this — update the app and retry. If you still see this, add an HTTPS-scanning exclusion for VoiceStudio/Python in your antivirus, or ask IT for the proxy's CA bundle and set SSL_CERT_FILE to it, then restart.",

Sign in to YouTube in your browser, export its cookies as a Netscape cookies.txt file (a cookies.txt browser extension does this), and attach it in Dub with “Choose a cookies.txt export” before importing the link again. The desktop app accepts cookie exports; a browser connection needs HTTPS. Or download the video yourself and upload the file.",
    "VIDEO_DRM_PROTECTED": "The video host only offered VoiceStudio a DRM-protected copy, which can't be downloaded. This is often not a property of the video itself — the host serves a different format set to different clients, and VoiceStudio already retried through every client it has. Try the link again in a minute, or download the video with a browser extension / the host's own download button and drop the file into Dubbing directly.",
    # #1301: distinct from SSL_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE. The handshake did not fail on

    # broken. Raw form is "[SSL: UNEXPECTED_EOF_WHILE_READING] EOF occurred in
    # violation of protocol (_ssl.c:1016)", which means nothing to anyone.
    "TLS_CONNECTION_DROPPED": "The secure connection was cut off mid-transfer — the other end (or something between you and it) closed the socket during the TLS exchange. This is almost always transient: flaky Wi-Fi, a VPN reconnecting, a captive portal, or a download server dropping a long transfer. Retrying is safe: a partly-downloaded MODEL is picked up where it left off rather than started over. If it repeats every time, a VPN or an HTTPS-inspecting proxy is terminating long-lived connections — try without the VPN, or on another network.",
    "VIDEO_DOWNLOAD_NETWORK": "The connection to the video server dropped mid-download (often a transient CDN/network blip or a regional rate-limit). Just retry — VoiceStudio already cleaned up the partial download. If it keeps failing, check your network/VPN.",

    # wins over the symptom.
    "MODEL_DOWNLOAD_INTERRUPTED": "A model download was cut off mid-request, and the component it was fetching then failed to load. Nothing is wrong with your install — reinstalling won't help, and the partial download is resumed rather than restarted. Just retry. If it keeps happening, check your connection (and any VPN, proxy or HF mirror setting); if only transcription is affected, switching ASR to faster-whisper in Model Catalogue avoids the pipeline that downloads this component.",
    "BROKEN_VENV": "The Python backend environment was moved or damaged. VoiceStudio rebuilds it automatically on the next launch; if it keeps failing, use Clean & Retry on the setup screen.",
    "MODEL_CACHE_CORRUPT": "A model file is missing or damaged — a download that stopped part-way, a broken link to downloaded data, or a file changed on disk after it arrived (interrupted renames and antivirus interference both cause this). VoiceStudio repairs it automatically and retries the load once, re-downloading the damaged file where a resume would not have replaced it. If the error persists, quit VoiceStudio, delete the model's models--<org>--<name> folder inside the Hugging Face cache, and restart — the model re-downloads automatically.",
