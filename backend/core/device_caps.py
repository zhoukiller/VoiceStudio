"""Canonical host compute-capability probe — the single source of truth for
"what can this machine actually accelerate on."

Every routing decision (the engine compatibility matrix, ``/setup/preflight``,
``/system/diagnose``, and the synth-time no-silent-fallback gating) reads from
``detect_host_caps()`` so the probe and the model loader can never disagree.

Design contract (load-bearing):
  - **Never raises** to a caller. A broken torch / driver crash degrades to a
    cached CPU-only ``probe_ok=False`` result; every endpoint stays responsive
    (local-first: the app must work with no GPU and even with a broken torch).
  - **No network call** — driver/sysctl reads only, no tensor allocation, so it
    stays kernel-free on cold start.
  - **No new regex** on any driver/device string (CodeQL py/polynomial-redos):
    the only string parse is the ``int(driver.split(".")[0])`` shape reused
    from the wizard, and arch comparison is plain list membership.
  - Distinguishes **ROCm from CUDA** (unlike the gguf ``hardware_probe``):
    ROCm-on-HIP presents through ``torch.cuda`` but is reported ``family="rocm"``.

The ``get_best_device()`` loader (``services.model_manager``) delegates its
*family* decision here while keeping its own DirectML branch and the ROCm
``HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION`` env side-effect — the probe **reads**, the loader
**writes**. (The gguf ``hardware_probe.detect_capabilities()`` rebase onto this
module is a deliberate follow-up: it has its own torch-mocked test suite and a
VRAM-driven quant table that is unaffected by the family rename, so it is kept
out of this backend-only slice.)

# form). Remapping onto an architecture the build doesn't ship is not a fix —

    The distinctions worth making are cheap, and the probe already knows them:

    * the wheel has no GPU support compiled in at all — no amount of
