    A synchronous ``ReadFile`` parked on the stdin pipe — whether issued through
    the C runtime's ``read()`` or straight to the kernel — deadlocks the
    OpenBLAS DLL initializer that ``import torch`` reaches (numpy's
    ``_multiarray_umath``) in the startup worker: every desktop-spawned backend
    on Windows froze at "Loading ML runtime (PyTorch)" while the identical
    command from a terminal, with no stdin pipe and no watchdog, started in
    seconds. A thread that merely sleeps does not trigger it; only the pending
    read on that pipe does. So instead of blocking in a read, poll with
    ``PeekNamedPipe``: it returns immediately, holds no I/O on the file object,
    drains any keepalive bytes the desktop might write, and fails with
    ``ERROR_BROKEN_PIPE`` the moment the desktop closes its end — which is the
    same EOF signal the POSIX reader gets.
