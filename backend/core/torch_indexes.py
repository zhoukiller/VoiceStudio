"""The PyTorch wheel index VoiceStudio installs CUDA builds from.

A local-version pin such as ``torch==2.9.1+cu128`` exists only on PyTorch's
own index, never on PyPI. The app's own ``pyproject.toml`` routes torch there
through ``[tool.uv.sources]``, but a sidecar engine is installed with
``uv pip install`` into its own venv, which knows nothing about that config —
so every CUDA-pinned sidecar install has to name the index itself.

MOSS-TTS-v1.5's install did not, and its ``[torch-runtime]`` extra
(``torch==2.9.1+cu128``) could never resolve: ``uv pip compile`` reports it
unsatisfiable without this index and resolves it with it. One definition here,
imported by the one-click installer and by the engine's own bootstrap, so the
two cannot drift apart again. ``tests/test_sidecar_install.py`` pins the URL
to the ``pytorch-cuda`` index declared in the app's ``pyproject.toml``.
