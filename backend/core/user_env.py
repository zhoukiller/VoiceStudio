"""Durable per-user environment file (`~/.config/omnivoice/env`).

`main.py` loads this file at startup (via dotenv) before importing torch/HF, so
values written here take effect on the next backend launch. Used by the
configurable models directory (#64): the Settings endpoint upserts
``OMNIVOICE_CACHE_DIR`` here, which main.py then maps to
``HF_HOME`` / ``HF_HUB_CACHE`` / ``TORCH_HOME``.

Format is dotenv-style ``KEY=value`` lines. Upsert preserves other keys (e.g. a
persisted ``HF_TOKEN``) and writes the file ``0600`` (it can hold secrets).
