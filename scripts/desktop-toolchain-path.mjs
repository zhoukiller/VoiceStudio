// desktop-toolchain-path.mjs — heal a stale PATH for the desktop launchers.
//
// Why this exists: every desktop launcher (`bun desktop`, `bun desktop-prod`,
// `bun desktop-fresh`) shells out to `cargo` (via the Tauri CLI) and to `uv`.
// A terminal opened *before* rustup / the uv installer ran keeps a PATH
// snapshot that lacks `~/.cargo/bin` / `~/.local/bin`, so the launcher dies with
//     failed to run 'cargo metadata' command … program not found
// even though the tool IS installed and IS on the persisted user PATH — a
// brand-new terminal would find it. `desktop-dev.mjs` healed this for `bun
// desktop` alone; `bun desktop-prod` then failed the exact same way on the
// next command the user typed. Every launcher now shares this one helper.
//
// Pure w.r.t. process state: it never mutates the env it is given (mutating
// process.env doesn't reliably propagate to children under Bun) and every
// probe is injectable so the behavior is unit-tested without a toolchain.
